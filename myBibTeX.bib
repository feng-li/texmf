	the margin of uncertainty which surrounds them. In November 1995
	the National Institute began to present estimates of the probability
	of the government's inflation target being met and of there being
	a fall in {GDP.} This article describes the methods that we use for
	calculating these probabilities. We show, by studying eight successive
	forecasts of the same event, how forecast reliability improves as
	the forecast horizon approaches and demonstrate that this can be
	explained in terms of the accumulation of information about the state
	of the economy.},

	a single consensus distribution upon which inferences and decisions
	can be based. An important feature of information from different
	sources is the possibility of stochastic dependence, and a consensus
	model which formally allows for such dependence is developed in this
	paper. Under normality, the model yields reasonably tractable results,
