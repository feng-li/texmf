	model the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition is well
	known to be rejected empirically. Therefore we explore the consequences
	of modifying the UIP condition to allow for a negative correlation
	between the risk premium and the expected change in the nominal exchange
	rate. The results show that the modification increases the persistence
	in the real exchange rate and that this model has an empirical advantage

	in the explanatory variables. The algorithm is an adaptation of that
	for nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML) estimation in overdispersedGLMs
	described in Aitkin (Statistics and Computing 6: 251262, 1996). The
	measurement error distribution can be of any specified form, though
	the implementation described assumes normal measurement error. Neither
	the reliability nor the distribution of the true score of the variables
	with measurement error has to be known, nor are instrumental variables
	or replication required. Standard errors can be obtained by omitting
	individual variables from the model, as in Aitkin (1996). Several
	examples are given, of normal and Bernoulli response variables.},

  number = {421},
  abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage
	estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed
	within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).
	Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed
	to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear
	predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances
	that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and
	a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed
	with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance
	components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation
	and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank
	deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal
	quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating
	equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean
	parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation
	involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation
	in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical
	arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude
	that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters
	and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The
	applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed
	germination; longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients;
	smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast
	cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects
	in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation;
	spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and
	the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving
	crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat
	the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when
	applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly
	for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

  abstract = {Background: Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized
	by excessive concerns about perceived defects or flaws in their appearance,
	most commonly, facial features. Previous research has shown that
	BDD sufferers, relative to mentally healthy controls, are characterized
	by emotion recognition deficits (particularly a bias to misinterpret
	neutral facial expressions in a negative way). It remains an open
	question though whether these deficits can be modified through specific
	training programs. Methods: To address this question, we evaluated
	emotion recognition among individuals with BDD (n = 34), individuals
	with a dermatological condition (n = 34), and mentally healthy control
	participants (n = 34) before and after a single-session emotion recognition
	training program. Results: As expected, BDD participants were overall
	significantly worse in identifying neutral expressions, relative
	to the other groups, whereas no difference was obtained between the
	dermatology and control groups. Further, with respect to neutral
	and scared expressions, BDD participants improved significantly more
	in the training condition, relative to the nontraining condition.
	Conclusion: There is initial evidence that deficits in recognizing
	neutral and scared expressions can be normalized through a specific
	training program when evaluated immediately after the training session.
	It needs to be addressed in future research whether emotion recognition
	training programs can diminish these deficits on the long term, and
	how improved emotion recognition might be related to BDD's symptom
	reduction such as decreased avoidance behaviors in social situations.

  abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has clearly demonstrated a higher
	sensitivity but somewhat lower specificity than cytology. However,
	there are still issues regarding how best to use it in primary screening.
	In countries where cytology is of good quality, the most interesting
	possibility for primary screening is to use HPV testing as the sole
	screening modality with cytology reserved for triage of HPV-positive
	women. In countries with a less established infrastructure, however,
	use of HPV alone would also be attractive, although rapid, simple
	tests followed by immediate treatment are needed to minimize the
	number of visits and make best use of limited resources. Several
	approaches to deal with the lower specificity of HPV testing are
	also examined. These include HPV typing with a different management
	strategy for HPV-16 and -18/45, use of viral load to exclude infections
	unlikely to be associated with > or =CIN-2, and markers of proliferative
	lesions such as p16 and mRNA or cell-cycle markers such as cdc6 or
	the mcm5 proteins. Micro-array studies offer the prospect of discovering
	new, better DNA- or RNA-based diagnostics. The fact that HPV is a
	sexually transmitted infection may lead to anxiety and concerns about
	sexual relationships and these issues are also discussed. Ongoing
	HPV studies are identified and briefly reviewed.},

  abstract = {We study the role of partial autocorrelations in the reparameterization
	and parsimonious modeling of a covariance matrix. The work is motivated
	by and tries to mimic the phenomenal success of the partial autocorrelations
	function (PACF) in model formulation, removing the positive-definiteness
	constraint on the autocorrelation function of a stationary time series
	and in reparameterizing the stationarity-invertibility domain of
	ARMA models. It turns out that once an order is fixed among the variables
	of a general random vector, then the above properties continue to
	hold and follows from establishing a one-to-one correspondence between
	a correlation matrix and its associated matrix of partial autocorrelations.
	Connections between the latter and the parameters of the modified
	Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix are discussed. Graphical
	tools similar to partial correlograms for model formulation and various
	priors based on the partial autocorrelations are proposed. We develop
	frequentist/Bayesian procedures for modelling correlation matrices,
	illustrate them using a real dataset, and explore their properties
	via simulations.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in
	many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric
	problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable
	prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric
	ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given
	sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution
	for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution
	should be large-with respect to some suitable topology on the space
	of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior
	distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability
	distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties
	are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense
	of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions,
	called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which
	(II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical
	problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable
	to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of
	the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet
	process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described
	as follows. Let X be a space and A a -field of subsets, and let be
	a finite non-null measure on (X, A). Then a stochastic process P
	indexed by elements A of A, is said to be a Dirichlet process on
	(X, A) with parameter if for any measurable partition (A1, Ak) of
	X, the random vector (P(A1), P(Ak)) has a Dirichlet distribution
	with parameter ( (A1), (Ak)). P may be considered a random probability
	measure on (X, A), The main theorem states that if P is a Dirichlet
	process on (X, A) with parameter and if X1, Xn is a sample from P,
	then the posterior distribution of P given X1, Xn is also a Dirichlet
	process on (X, A) with a parameter + n 1 xi , where x denotes the
	measure giving mass one to the point x. In Section 4, an alternative
	definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits
	a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to
	the set of discrete probability measures on (X, A). This is in contrast
	to Dubins and Freedman 2, whose methods for choosing a distribution
	function on the interval 0, 1 lead with probability one to singular
	continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function
	on 0, 1 that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been
	described by Kraft 7. The general method of choosing a distribution
	function on 0, 1, described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden 10,
	can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on 0, 1. Special
	mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman
	5 defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all
	probability measures on a countable space X. For a tailfree prior,
	posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure
	may be fairly easily computed. Fabius 3 extends the notion of tailfree
	to the case where X is the unit interval 0, 1, but it is clear his
	extension may be made to cover quite general X. With such an extension,
	the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution
	for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form.
	There are disadvantages to the fact that P chosen by a Dirichlet
	process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because
	in sampling from a P chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually
	to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider
	the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis H0 that a distribution
	on the interval 0, 1 is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis
	we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter itself a uniform
	measure on 0, 1, and if we are given a sample of size n 2, the only
	nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject H0 if and only if
	two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really
	a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against
	the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for
	a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one
	and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which
	the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays
	no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation
	of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance
	and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which
	the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic,
	appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for
	a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem
	concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of
	these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the
	statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his
	Ph. D. dissertation 1, Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider
	mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including
	the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes
	problems, and discrimination problems.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related
	biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers
	from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed
	first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method
	for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed
	to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters
	of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed
	to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method,
	we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead
	of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection
	method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification
	simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable
	bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection
	method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold.
	Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset
	show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability
	to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces
	false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related
	biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers
	from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed
	first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method
	for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed
	to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters
	of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed
	to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method,
	we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead
	of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection
	method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification
	simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable
	bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection
	method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold.
	Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset
	show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability
	to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces
	false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

	false recognition. A widely held view is that this error occurs because
	the details fade rapidly from our memory. Contrary to this view,
	an initial experiment revealed that, following the same encoding
	conditions that produce high rates of gist-based false recognition,
	participants overwhelmingly chose the correct target rather than
	its related foil when given the option to do so. A second experiment
	showed that this result is due to increased access to stored details
	provided by reinstatement of the originally encoded photograph, rather
	than to increased attention to the details. Collectively, these results
	suggest that details needed for accurate recognition are, to a large
	extent, still stored in memory and that a critical factor determining
	whether false recognition will occur is whether these details can
	be accessed during retrieval.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the number of components d and
	the unknown mixing distribution in a finite mixture model, in which
	d is bounded by some fixed finite number N. Our approach relies on
	the use of a prior over the space of mixing distributions with at
	most N components. By decomposing the resulting marginal density
	under this prior, we discover a weighted Bayes factor method for
	consistently estimating d that can be implemented by an iid generalized
	weighted Chinese restaurant (GWCR) Monte Carlo algorithm. We also
	discuss a Gibbs sampling method (the blocked Gibbs sampler) for estimating
	d and also the mixing distribution. We show that our resulting posterior
	is consistent and achieves the frequentist optimal Op(n-1/4) rate
	of estimation. We compare the performance of the new GWCR model selection
	procedure with that of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayes
	information criterion implemented through an EM algorithm. Applications
	of our methods to five real datasets and simulations are considered.},

  abstract = {In the first part of the paper, a single degree-of-freedom model of
	a vibrating membrane with piezoelectric inserts is introduced and
	is initially applied to the case when a plane wave is incident with
	frequency close to one of the resonance frequencies. The model is
	a prototype of a device which converts ambient acoustical energy
	to electrical energy with the use of piezoelectric devices. The paper
	then proposes an enhancement of the energy harvesting process using
	a nonlinear processing of the output voltage of piezoelectric actuators,
	and suggests that this improves the energy conversion and reduces
	the sensitivity to frequency drifts. A theoretical discussion is
	given for the electrical power that can be expected making use of
	various models. This and supporting experimental results suggest
	that a nonlinear optimization approach allows a gain of up to 10
	in harvested energy and a doubling of the bandwidth. A model is introduced
	in the latter part of the paper for predicting the behavior of the
	energy-harvesting device with changes in acoustic frequency, this
	model taking into account the damping effect and the frequency changes
	introduced by the nonlinear processes in the device.},

	We point out that traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean

	studies where inappropriate distance measures have been used.We propose
	a simple measure based on the idea that the space spanned by the

	the space spanned by the matrix itself. Several properties of this

  abstract = {Methods for choosing a fixed set of knot locations in additive spline
	models are fairly well established in the statistical literature.
	While most of these methods are in principle directly extendable
	to non-additive surface models, they are likely to be less successful
	in that setting because of the curse of dimensionality, especially
	when there are more than a couple of covariates. We propose a regression
	model for a multivariate Gaussian response that combines both additive
	splines and interactive splines, and a highly efficient MCMC algorithm
	that updates all the multivariate knot locations jointly. We use
	shrinkage priors to avoid overfitting with different estimated shrinkage
	factors for the additive and surface part of the model, and also
	different shrinkage parameters for the different response variables.
	This makes it possible for the model to adapt to varying degrees
	of nonlinearity in different parts of the data in a parsimonious
	way. Simulated data and an application to firm leverage data show
	that the approach is computationally efficient, and that allowing
	for freely estimated knot locations can offer a substantial improvement
	in out-of-sample predictive performance.},

	models are restricted to using "conjugate" base measures that allow
	analytic evaluation of the transition probabilities when resampling

	evaluations of some transition probabilities. Implementation of Gibbs
	sampling in more general MDP models is an open and important problem
	because most applications call for the use of nonconjugate base measures.
	In this article we propose a conceptual framework for computational
	strategies. This framework provides a perspective on current methods,
	facilitates comparisons between them, and leads to several new methods
	that expand the scope of MDP models to nonconjugate situations. We
	discuss one in detail. The basic strategy is based on expanding the
	parameter vector, and is applicable for MDP models with arbitrary
	base measure and likelihood. Strategies are also presented for the
	important class of normal-normal MDP models and for problems with
	fixed or few hyperparameters. The proposed algorithms are easily
	implemented and illustrated with an application.},

	of a fully polarized beam. It deals with a beam having spatially
	homogeneous polarization. In recent years, axially symmetric polarized
	beams, where the polarization is not homogeneous in its cross section,
	have attracted great interest. In the present article, we show the
	formula for the rotation of beams and optical elements on the angularly
	variant term-added Jones calculus, which is required for analyzing
	axially symmetric beams. In addition, we introduce an extension of
	the Jones calculus: use of the polar coordinate basis. With this
	calculus, the representation of some angularly variant beams and
	optical elements are simplified and become intuitive. We show definitions,
	examples, and conversion formulas between different notations.},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {Tests of statistical hypotheses concerning treatment effect on the
	development of hepatocellular foci can be carried out directly on
	two-dimensional observations made on histologic sections or on estimates
	of the density and volume of foci in three dimensions. Inferences
	about differences in the density or size of foci from tests based
	on two-dimensional observations, however, can be misleading. This
	is because both the number of focus cross-sections observed in a
	tissue section and the percent area occupied by foci can be expressed
	in terms of the number of foci per unit volume of liver tissue and
	the mean focus size. As a consequence, a treatment difference may
	be caused by a difference in the density of foci, their average size,
	or both. Of more serious concern is the possibility that failure
	to detect a treatment effect may occur not only when there is no
	treatment effect but also when the density and size of foci differ
	between treatments in such a way that their product is unchanged.
	This can happen if the effect of treatment is to increase the number
	of foci and decrease their average size, or vice versa. A similar
	difficulty of interpretation is associated with hypothesis tests
	based on average focus cross-section area. Tests based on estimates
	of the number of foci per unit volume and mean focus volume allow
	direct inference about the quantities of interest, but these estimates
	are unstable because they have large variances. Empirical estimates
	of statistical power for the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the t-test
	from data on control rats suggest power may be limited in experiments
	with group sizes of ten and low observed numbers of focus cross-sections.
	If hypothesis tests based on estimates of the density and size of
	foci are to form the basis for a bioassay, then the power of statistical
	tests used to identify treatment effects should be investigated.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to test a liquid-based saliva collection
	system for total antioxidant status (TAS), uric acid (UA), total
	protein concentration (TP) and salivary alpha-amylase (SAA) activity;
	to determine if these analytes in serum and saliva are correlated
	in a physically active population and to establish reference intervals
	for these parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in this study
	were 115 physically active males (18-20years old). Saliva samples
	were collected using the Saliva Collection System (Greiner Bio-One®)
	immediately before obtaining blood. Biochemical analyses were conducted
	using an Autolab Boehringer analyzer. RESULTS: We found a correlation
	between UA and TP concentrations in serum and saliva samples. The
	reference intervals for TP and SAA activity in the morning were lower
	than in the afternoon (p<0.0001). The reference intervals for UA
	and TAS did not vary with the time of collection. CONCLUSION: The
	establishment of reference intervals for these saliva constituents
	increases their diagnostic utility and allows for detection of physiological
	or pathological states.},

  abstract = {Inference for Dirichlet process hierarchical models is typically performed
	using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which can be roughly categorised
	into marginal and conditional methods. The former integrate out analytically
	the infinite-dimensional component of the hierarchical model and
	sample from the marginal distribution of the remaining variables
	using the Gibbs sampler. Conditional methods impute the Dirichlet
	process and update it as a component of the Gibbs sampler. Since
	this requires imputation of an infinite-dimensional process, implementation
	of the conditional method has relied on finite approximations. In
	this paper we show how to avoid such approximations by designing
	two novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms which sample from the
	exact posterior distribution of quantities of interest. The approximations
	are avoided by the new technique of retrospective sampling. We also
	show how the algorithms can obtain samples from functionals of the
	Dirichlet process. The marginal and the conditional methods are compared
	and a careful simulation study is included, which involves a non-conjugate
	model, different datasets and prior specifications.},

  abstract = {Ways of obtaining approximate Bayes factors for generalised linear
	models are described, based on the Laplace method for integrals.
	We propose a new approximation which uses only the output of standard
	computer programs for estimating generalised linear models, this
	appears to be quite accurate. A reference set of proper priors is
	suggested, both to represent the situation where there is not much
	prior information, and to assess the sensitivity of the results to
	the prior distribution. The methods can be used when the dispersion
	parameter is unknown, when there is overdispersion, to compare link
	functions, and to compare error distributions and variance functions.
	The methods can be used to implement the Bayesian approach to accounting
	for model uncertainty. We describe an applciation to inference about
	relative risks in the presence of control factors where model uncertainty
	is large and important. Software to implement the methods is available
	at no cost from StatLib.},

  abstract = {The past few years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding
	of the genetics underlying complex disease, with associated variants
	being identified in dozens of traits. Despite the fact that this
	growing body of empirical evidence unequivocally shows the necessity
	for extreme levels of significance and large samples sizes, the reasoning
	behind these requirements is not always appreciated. As genome-wide
	association studies reach the limits of their resolution in the search
	for rarer and weaker effects, the need for appropriate design and
	interpretation will become ever more important. If the genetic analysis
	of complex disease is to avoid accumulating false positive claims,
	as it has in the past, then researchers will need to allow for less
	tangible variables such as power and prior odds rather than relying
	exclusively on significance when assessing the results of these studies.
	In this review, the basic foundations of association testing are
	explained from a Bayesian perspective and the potential benefits
	of Bayes factors as a means of measuring the weight of evidence in
	support of an association are described.},

	planning protocol in combination with previously placed reference
	elements and computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture
	(CAD/CAM) technology to restore the partially edentulous patient.
	Materials and Methods: Mini-implants and/or reference brackets were
	inserted or positioned in specified locations in a test cast and
	in two patients prior to imaging to act as definitive fiducial markers.
	This served as a fixed base to better define a setup for the fabrication
	of a surgical template used during computed tomographic imaging.
	A simulated partially edentulous maxilla was used for the study,
	and two partially edentulous patients participated. With the CT images,
	a CAD/CAM superstructure was created prior to surgery and inserted
	immediately after surgery. Fit of the prosthesis was assessed using
	three-dimensional tension measurements with strain gauges. Results:
	Mean misfit for all implants in the x-, y-, and z-axes was 26.6,
	24.8, and 10.4 Μm, respectively. The total misfit calculated according
	to the Pythagorean theorem was 42.6 Μm. Conclusions: Based upon this
	pilot study in two patients and an in vitro analysis, it appears
	that the use of reproducible fiducial markers consisting of mini-implants
	and reference brackets results in the fabrication of an acceptably
	accurately fitting definitive prosthesis prior to implant placement.

	The closed form of the likelihood allows inference to proceed in

	a framework for a simple scoring algorithm to estimate the parameters.
	The algorithm includes a procedure to estimate the degrees of freedom
	parameter of the t distribution. Homogeneity and asymptotic tests
	are discussed and a methodology is derived to detect heteroscedasticity
	when the response is t distributed. Simulations reveal considerable
	bias in the estimates of the degrees of freedom parameter and only
	minor bias in the estimated fixed effects associated with the scale
	parameter. In comparison, the estimated location effects are well
	behaved. To illustrate the joint modelling of location and scale
	parameters of the t distribution the methodology is applied to two

  abstract = {A neglected aspect of the otherwise fairly well developed Bayesian
	analysis of cointegration is point estimation of the cointegration
	space. It is pointed out here that, due to the well known non-identification
	of the cointegration vectors, the parameter space is not Euclidean
	and the loss functions underlying the conventional Bayes estimators
	are therefore questionable. We present a Bayes estimator of the cointegration
	space which takes the curved geometry of the parameter space into
	account. This estimate has the interpretation of being the posterior
	mean cointegration space and is invariant to the order of the time
	series, a property not shared with many of the Bayes estimators in
	the cointegration literature. An overall measure of cointegration

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related
	biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers
	from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed
	first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method
	for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed
	to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters
	of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed
	to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method,
	we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead
	of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection
	method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification
	simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable
	bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection
	method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold.
	Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset
	show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability
	to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces
	false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The p53 pathway plays a critical role in maintaining genomic
	stability and preventing tumor formation. Given the roles of both
	MDM4 and HPV16 E6 oncoproteins in inhibition of p53 activity, we
	tested the hypothesis that MDM4 polymorphisms are associated with
	the risk of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of head and
	neck (SCCHN). METHODS: Genotyping was conducted on 3 tagging single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11801299 G>A, rs10900598 G>T, and rs1380576
	C>G) in MDM4, and serology was used to determine HPV 16 exposure
	in 380 cases and 335 cancer-free controls that were frequency-matched
	by age, sex, smoking, and drinking status. RESULTS: None of 3 MDM4
	polymorphisms alone was significantly associated with risk of overall
	SCCHN. With further analysis stratified by HPV16 serology and tumor
	site, we found that each polymorphism individually modified the risk
	of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP),
	and such effect modification was particularly pronounced in never
	smokers and never drinkers. CONCLUSION: The risk of HPV16-associated
	SCCOP could be modified by MDM4 polymorphisms. Large and prospective
	studies are needed to validate our findings. Cancer 2011;. © 2011

  volume = {21},
  pages = {35--51},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Linear mixed models are able to handle an extraordinary range of complications
	in regression-type analyses. Their most common use is to account
	for within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They
	are also the standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However,
	when treated in full generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type
	smoothing and closely approximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric
	regression models (e.g., additive models and varying coefficient
	models) to be handled within the mixed model framework. The key is
	to allow the random effects design matrix to have general structure;
	hence our label general design. For continuous response data, particularly
	when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed, computation
	is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS packages.
	Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where generalized
	linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the
	presence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to
	us supports special cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS
	or glmmML in R) or relies on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation
	of integrals (e.g., the SAS macro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This
	paper describes the fitting of general design generalized linear
	mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov chain Monte
	Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this generalized
	setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In
	this article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates
	sound fitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed
	models in practice.},
