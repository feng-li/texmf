@article{Stanislaw2002,
abstract = {The analysis of traffic safety data archives has improved markedly with the development of procedures that are heavily dependent upon computers. Three such procedures are described here. The first procedure involves using computers to assist in the identification and correction of invalid data. The second procedure makes greater computational demands, and involves using computerized algorithms to fill in the "gaps" that typically occur in archival data when information regarding key variables is not available. The third and most computer-intensive procedure involves using data mining techniques to search archives for interesting and important relationships between variables. These procedures are illustrated using examples from data archives that describe the characteristics of traffic accidents in the USA and Australia.},

@article{Buhlmann2011,
abstract = {Background: Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by excessive concerns about perceived defects or flaws in their appearance, most commonly, facial features. Previous research has shown that BDD sufferers, relative to mentally healthy controls, are characterized by emotion recognition deficits (particularly a bias to misinterpret neutral facial expressions in a negative way). It remains an open question though whether these deficits can be modified through specific training programs. Methods: To address this question, we evaluated emotion recognition among individuals with BDD (n = 34), individuals with a dermatological condition (n = 34), and mentally healthy control participants (n = 34) before and after a single-session emotion recognition training program. Results: As expected, BDD participants were overall significantly worse in identifying neutral expressions, relative to the other groups, whereas no difference was obtained between the dermatology and control groups. Further, with respect to neutral and scared expressions, BDD participants improved significantly more in the training condition, relative to the nontraining condition. Conclusion: There is initial evidence that deficits in recognizing neutral and scared expressions can be normalized through a specific training program when evaluated immediately after the training session. It needs to be addressed in future research whether emotion recognition training programs can diminish these deficits on the long term, and how improved emotion recognition might be related to BDD's symptom reduction such as decreased avoidance behaviors in social situations.

abstract = {A neglected aspect of the otherwise fairly well developed Bayesian analysis of cointegration is point estimation of the cointegration space. It is pointed out here that, due to the well known non-identification of the cointegration vectors, the parameter space is not Euclidean and the loss functions underlying the conventional Bayes estimators are therefore questionable. We present a Bayes estimator of the cointegration space which takes the curved geometry of the parameter space into account. This estimate has the interpretation of being the posterior mean cointegration space and is invariant to the order of the time series, a property not shared with many of the Bayes estimators in the cointegration literature. An overall measure of cointegration space uncertainty is also proposed. Australian interest rate data are used for illustration. A small simulation study shows that the new Bayes estimator compares favorably to the maximum likelihood estimator.},

abstract = {People often falsely recognize items that are similar to previously encountered items. This robust memory error is referred to as gist-based false recognition. A widely held view is that this error occurs because the details fade rapidly from our memory. Contrary to this view, an initial experiment revealed that, following the same encoding conditions that produce high rates of gist-based false recognition, participants overwhelmingly chose the correct target rather than its related foil when given the option to do so. A second experiment showed that this result is due to increased access to stored details provided by reinstatement of the originally encoded photograph, rather than to increased attention to the details. Collectively, these results suggest that details needed for accurate recognition are, to a large extent, still stored in memory and that a critical factor determining whether false recognition will occur is whether these details can be accessed during retrieval.},

An estimated stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model of the Euro area. Journal of the European Economic Association 1(5), 11231175 using Bayesian estimation techniques on Swedish data. To account for the switch to an inflation targeting regime in 1993 we allow for a discrete break in the central bank's instrument rule. A key equation in the model the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition is well known to be rejected empirically. Therefore we explore the consequences of modifying the UIP condition to allow for a negative correlation between the risk premium and the expected change in the nominal exchange rate. The results show that the modification increases the persistence in the real exchange rate and that this model has an empirical advantage compared with the standard UIP specification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The p53 pathway plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumor formation. Given the roles of both MDM4 and HPV16 E6 oncoproteins in inhibition of p53 activity, we tested the hypothesis that MDM4 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). METHODS: Genotyping was conducted on 3 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11801299 G>A, rs10900598 G>T, and rs1380576 C>G) in MDM4, and serology was used to determine HPV 16 exposure in 380 cases and 335 cancer-free controls that were frequency-matched by age, sex, smoking, and drinking status. RESULTS: None of 3 MDM4 polymorphisms alone was significantly associated with risk of overall SCCHN. With further analysis stratified by HPV16 serology and tumor site, we found that each polymorphism individually modified the risk of HPV16-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP), and such effect modification was particularly pronounced in never smokers and never drinkers.

abstract = {Ways of obtaining approximate Bayes factors for generalised linear models are described, based on the Laplace method for integrals. We propose a new approximation which uses only the output of standard computer programs for estimating generalised linear models, this appears to be quite accurate. A reference set of proper priors is suggested, both to represent the situation where there is not much prior information, and to assess the sensitivity of the results to the prior distribution. The methods can be used when the dispersion parameter is unknown, when there is overdispersion, to compare link functions, and to compare error distributions and variance functions. The methods can be used to implement the Bayesian approach to accounting for model uncertainty. We describe an applciation to inference about relative risks in the presence of control factors where model uncertainty is large and important. Software to implement the methods is available at no cost from StatLib.},

We point out that traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean measure, are not reasonable to use when measuring distances between spaces. This point has been either missed or ignored in many simulation studies where inappropriate distance measures have been used.We propose a simple measure based on the idea that the space spanned by the orthogonal complement of a matrix lies as far away as possible from the space spanned by the matrix itself.

@article{Ishwaran2001,
abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the number of components d and the unknown mixing distribution in a finite mixture model, in which d is bounded by some fixed finite number N. Our approach relies on the use of a prior over the space of mixing distributions with at most N components. By decomposing the resulting marginal density under this prior, we discover a weighted Bayes factor method for consistently estimating d that can be implemented by an iid generalized weighted Chinese restaurant (GWCR) Monte Carlo algorithm. We also discuss a Gibbs sampling method (the blocked Gibbs sampler) for estimating d and also the mixing distribution. We show that our resulting posterior is consistent and achieves the frequentist optimal Op(n-1/4) rate of estimation. We compare the performance of the new GWCR model selection procedure with that of the Akaike information criterion and the Bayes information criterion implemented through an EM algorithm. Applications of our methods to five real datasets and simulations are considered.},

The large degree of uncertainty in the choice of cointegration vectors is incorporated into the analysis via the prior distribution. This prior has the effect of weighing the predictive distributions based on the models with different cointegration vectors into an overall predictive distribution. The ideas of Litterman Mimeo, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1980 are adopted for the prior on the short run dynamics of the process resulting in a prior which only depends on a few hyperparameters. A straightforward numerical evaluation of the predictive distribution based on Gibbs sampling is proposed. The prediction procedure is applied to a seven-variable system with a focus on forecasting Swedish inflation.},

abstract = {Inference for Dirichlet process hierarchical models is typically performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which can be roughly categorised into marginal and conditional methods. The former integrate out analytically the infinite-dimensional component of the hierarchical model and sample from the marginal distribution of the remaining variables using the Gibbs sampler. Conditional methods impute the Dirichlet process and update it as a component of the Gibbs sampler. Since this requires imputation of an infinite-dimensional process, implementation of the conditional method has relied on finite approximations. In this paper we show how to avoid such approximations by designing two novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms which sample from the exact posterior distribution of quantities of interest. The approximations are avoided by the new technique of retrospective sampling. We also show how the algorithms can obtain samples from functionals of the Dirichlet process. The marginal and the conditional methods are compared and a careful simulation study is included, which involves a non-conjugate model, different datasets and prior specifications.},

abstract = {Current Gibbs sampling schemes in mixture of Dirichlet process (MDP) models are restricted to using "conjugate" base measures that allow analytic evaluation of the transition probabilities when resampling configurations, or alternatively need to rely on approximate numeric evaluations of some transition probabilities. Implementation of Gibbs sampling in more general MDP models is an open and important problem because most applications call for the use of nonconjugate base measures. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for computational strategies. This framework provides a perspective on current methods, facilitates comparisons between them, and leads to several new methods that expand the scope of MDP models to nonconjugate situations. We discuss one in detail. The basic strategy is based on expanding the parameter vector, and is applicable for MDP models with arbitrary base measure and likelihood. Strategies are also presented for the important class of normal-normal MDP models and for problems with fixed or few hyperparameters. The proposed algorithms are easily implemented and illustrated with an application.},

@article{Zeger1991,
abstract = {Generalized linear models have unified the approach to regression for a wide variety of discrete, continuous, and censored response variables that can be assumed to be independent across experimental units. In applications such as longitudinal studies, genetic studies of families, and survey sampling, observations may be obtained in clusters. Responses from the same cluster cannot be assumed to be independent. With linear models, correlation has been effectively modeled by assuming there are cluster-specific random effects that derive from an underlying mixing distribution. Extensions of generalized linear models to include random effects has, thus far, been hampered by the need for numerical integration to evaluate likelihoods. In this article, we cast the generalized linear random effects model in a Bayesian framework and use a Monte Carlo method, the Gibbs sampler, to overcome the current computational limitations. The resulting algorithm is flexible to easily accommodate changes in the number of random effects and in their assumed distribution when warranted. The methodology is illustrated through a simulation study and an analysis of infectious disease data.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in this study were 115 physically active males (18-20years old). Saliva samples were collected using the Saliva Collection System (Greiner Bio-One®) immediately before obtaining blood. Biochemical analyses were conducted using an Autolab Boehringer analyzer. RESULTS: We found a correlation between UA and TP concentrations in serum and saliva samples. The reference intervals for TP and SAA activity in the morning were lower than in the afternoon (p<0.0001). The reference intervals for UA and TAS did not vary with the time of collection. CONCLUSION: The establishment of reference intervals for these saliva constituents increases their diagnostic utility and allows for detection of physiological or pathological states.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become a essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Earlier, Grelaud et al. (2009) advocated the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al., 2008), we now present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure are necessary to conduct model choice.},

abstract = {This article reviews Markov chain methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of a Dirichlet process mixture model and presents two new classes of methods. One new approach is to make Metropolis-Hastings updates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of Gibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways of handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate priors.},

abstract = {New methodology for fully Bayesian mixture analysis is developed, making use of reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, that are capable of jumping between the parameter subspaces corresponding to different numbers of components in the mixture. A sample from the full joint distribution of all unknown variables is thereby generated, and this can be used as a basis for a thorough presentation of many aspects of the posterior distribution. The methodology is applied here to the analysis of univariate normal mixtures, using a hierarchical prior model that offers an approach to dealing with weak prior information while avoiding the mathematical pitfalls of using improper priors in the mixture context.},

@article{Lallart2010,
abstract = {In the first part of the paper, a single degree-of-freedom model of a vibrating membrane with piezoelectric inserts is introduced and is initially applied to the case when a plane wave is incident with frequency close to one of the resonance frequencies. The model is a prototype of a device which converts ambient acoustical energy to electrical energy with the use of piezoelectric devices. The paper then proposes an enhancement of the energy harvesting process using a nonlinear processing of the output voltage of piezoelectric actuators, and suggests that this improves the energy conversion and reduces the sensitivity to frequency drifts. A theoretical discussion is given for the electrical power that can be expected making use of various models. This and supporting experimental results suggest that a nonlinear optimization approach allows a gain of up to 10 in harvested energy and a doubling of the bandwidth. A model is introduced in the latter part of the paper for predicting the behavior of the energy-harvesting device with changes in acoustic frequency, this model taking into account the damping effect and the frequency changes introduced by the nonlinear processes in the device.},

abstract = {We propose a class of double hierarchical generalized linear models in which random effects can be specified for both the mean and dispersion. Heteroscedasticity between clusters can be modelled by introducing random effects in the dispersion model, as is heterogeneity between clusters in the mean model. This class will, among other things, enable models with heavy-tailed distributions to be explored, providing robust estimation against outliers. The h-likelihood provides a unified framework for this new class of models and gives a single algorithm for fitting all members of the class. This algorithm does not require quadrature or prior probabilities.},

The algorithm is an adaptation of that for nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML) estimation in overdispersedGLMs described in Aitkin (Statistics and Computing 6: 251262, 1996). The measurement error distribution can be of any specified form, though the implementation described assumes normal measurement error. Neither the reliability nor the distribution of the true score of the variables with measurement error has to be known, nor are instrumental variables or replication required. Standard errors can be obtained by omitting individual variables from the model, as in Aitkin (1996). Several examples are given, of normal and Bernoulli response variables.},

When the variance term is null we obtain a generalized additive model, which becomes a generalized linear model if the predictors enter the mean linearly. The model is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and the methodology is illustrated using real and simulated data sets.},

The process is constructed by first introducing an infinite sequence of random locations. Independent random probability measures and beta-distributed random weights are assigned to each location. Predictor-dependent random probability measures are then constructed by mixing over the locations, with stick-breaking probabilities expressed as a kernel multiplied by the beta weights. Some theoretical properties of the process are described, including a covariate-dependent prediction rule. A retrospective Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for posterior computation, and the methods are illustrated using a simulated example and an epidemiological application.},

Combined with a parallel transformation implementation and an improved optimization algorithm, our method achieves real-time (less than 1s) rigid registration of 3D medical images using a commodity graphics processing unit (GPU). This represents a more than 50-fold improvement over a standard implementation on a CPU. Real-time registration opens new possibilities for development of improved and interactive intraoperative tools that can be used for enhanced visualization and navigation during an intervention.},

@article{Green2008,
abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method, we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold. Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution should be large-with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions, called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which (II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described as follows. Let X be a space and A a -field of subsets, and let be a finite non-null measure on (X, A). Then a stochastic process P indexed by elements A of A, is said to be a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with parameter if for any measurable partition (A1, Ak) of X, the random vector (P(A1), P(Ak)) has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter ( (A1), (Ak)). P may be considered a random probability measure on (X, A), The main theorem states that if P is a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with parameter and if X1, Xn is a sample from P, then the posterior distribution of P given X1, Xn is also a Dirichlet process on (X, A) with a parameter + n 1 xi , where x denotes the measure giving mass one to the point x. In Section 4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on (X, A). This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman 2, whose methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval 0, 1 lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function on 0, 1 that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft 7. The general method of choosing a distribution function on 0, 1, described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden 10, can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on 0, 1. Special mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman 5 defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures on a countable space X. For a tailfree prior, posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may be fairly easily computed. Fabius 3 extends the notion of tailfree to the case where X is the unit interval 0, 1, but it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general X. With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact that P chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a P chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis H0 that a distribution on the interval 0, 1 is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter itself a uniform measure on 0, 1, and if we are given a sample of size n 2, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject H0 if and only if two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his Ph. D. dissertation 1, Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the evaluation of methods for scattered data interpolation and some of the results of the tests when applied to a number of methods. The process involves evaluation of the methods in terms of timing, storage, accuracy, visual pleasantness of the surface, and ease of implementation. To indicate the flavor of the type of results obtained, we give a summary table and representative perspective plots of several surfaces.},

@article{Sawcer2010,
abstract = {The past few years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of the genetics underlying complex disease, with associated variants being identified in dozens of traits. Despite the fact that this growing body of empirical evidence unequivocally shows the necessity for extreme levels of significance and large samples sizes, the reasoning behind these requirements is not always appreciated. As genome-wide association studies reach the limits of their resolution in the search for rarer and weaker effects, the need for appropriate design and interpretation will become ever more important. If the genetic analysis of complex disease is to avoid accumulating false positive claims, as it has in the past, then researchers will need to allow for less tangible variables such as power and prior odds rather than relying exclusively on significance when assessing the results of these studies. In this review, the basic foundations of association testing are explained from a Bayesian perspective and the potential benefits of Bayes factors as a means of measuring the weight of evidence in support of an association are described.},

@article{Daniels2009,
abstract = {We study the role of partial autocorrelations in the reparameterization and parsimonious modeling of a covariance matrix. The work is motivated by and tries to mimic the phenomenal success of the partial autocorrelations function (PACF) in model formulation, removing the positive-definiteness constraint on the autocorrelation function of a stationary time series and in reparameterizing the stationarity-invertibility domain of ARMA models. It turns out that once an order is fixed among the variables of a general random vector, then the above properties continue to hold and follows from establishing a one-to-one correspondence between a correlation matrix and its associated matrix of partial autocorrelations. Connections between the latter and the parameters of the modified Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix are discussed. Graphical tools similar to partial correlograms for model formulation and various priors based on the partial autocorrelations are proposed. We develop frequentist/Bayesian procedures for modelling correlation matrices, illustrate them using a real dataset, and explore their properties via simulations.},

@article{Breslow1993,
abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed germination; longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

abstract = {We propose a new class of semiparametric generalized linear models. As with existing models, these models are specified via a linear predictor and a link function for the mean of response Y as a function of predictors X. Here, however, the "baseline" distribution of Y at a given reference mean mu(0) is left unspecified and is estimated from the data. The response distribution when the mean differs from mu(0) is then generated via exponential tilting of the baseline distribution, yielding a response model that is a natural exponential family, with corresponding canonical link and variance functions. The resulting model has a level of flexibility similar to the popular proportional odds model. Maximum likelihood estimation is developed for response distributions with finite support, and the new model is studied and illustrated through simulations and example analyses from aging research.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has clearly demonstrated a higher sensitivity but somewhat lower specificity than cytology. However, there are still issues regarding how best to use it in primary screening. In countries where cytology is of good quality, the most interesting possibility for primary screening is to use HPV testing as the sole screening modality with cytology reserved for triage of HPV-positive women. In countries with a less established infrastructure, however, use of HPV alone would also be attractive, although rapid, simple tests followed by immediate treatment are needed to minimize the number of visits and make best use of limited resources. Several approaches to deal with the lower specificity of HPV testing are also examined. These include HPV typing with a different management strategy for HPV-16 and -18/45, use of viral load to exclude infections unlikely to be associated with > or =CIN-2, and markers of proliferative lesions such as p16 and mRNA or cell-cycle markers such as cdc6 or the mcm5 proteins. Micro-array studies offer the prospect of discovering new, better DNA- or RNA-based diagnostics. The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection may lead to anxiety and concerns about sexual relationships and these issues are also discussed. Ongoing HPV studies are identified and briefly reviewed.},

@article{Zhao2006,
abstract = {Linear mixed models are able to handle an extraordinary range of complications in regression-type analyses. Their most common use is to account for within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in full generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely approximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g., additive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed model framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have general structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response data, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed, computation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS packages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the presence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports special cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or glmmML in R) or relies on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS macro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general design generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this generalized setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In this article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates sound fitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed models in practice.},

In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Inference is based on the posterior density of the spline and an associated smoothing parameter and is performed by means of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Examples of the application of the new technique to two real environmental data sets and to simulated data for which polynomial modelling is inappropriate are given. An aid for making a good choice of proposal density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is discussed. The new nonparametric methodology provides more flexible modelling than the currently used Bayesian parametric quantile regression approach},

@book{Morris1989,
abstract = {Tests of statistical hypotheses concerning treatment effect on the development of hepatocellular foci can be carried out directly on two-dimensional observations made on histologic sections or on estimates of the density and volume of foci in three dimensions. Inferences about differences in the density or size of foci from tests based on two-dimensional observations, however, can be misleading. This is because both the number of focus cross-sections observed in a tissue section and the percent area occupied by foci can be expressed in terms of the number of foci per unit volume of liver tissue and the mean focus size. As a consequence, a treatment difference may be caused by a difference in the density of foci, their average size, or both. Of more serious concern is the possibility that failure to detect a treatment effect may occur not only when there is no treatment effect but also when the density and size of foci differ between treatments in such a way that their product is unchanged. This can happen if the effect of treatment is to increase the number of foci and decrease their average size, or vice versa. A similar difficulty of interpretation is associated with hypothesis tests based on average focus cross-section area. Tests based on estimates of the number of foci per unit volume and mean focus volume allow direct inference about the quantities of interest, but these estimates are unstable because they have large variances. Empirical estimates of statistical power for the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the t-test from data on control rats suggest power may be limited in experiments with group sizes of ten and low observed numbers of focus cross-sections. If hypothesis tests based on estimates of the density and size of foci are to form the basis for a bioassay, then the power of statistical tests used to identify treatment effects should be investigated.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {Methods for choosing a fixed set of knot locations in additive spline models are fairly well established in the statistical literature. While most of these methods are in principle directly extendable to non-additive surface models, they are less likely to be successful in that setting because of the curse of dimensionality, especially when there are more than a couple of covariates. We propose a regression model for a multivariate Gaussian response that combines both additive splines and interactive splines, and a highly efficient MCMC algorithm that updates all the knot locations jointly. We use shrinkage priors to avoid overfitting with different estimated shrinkage factors for the additive and surface part of the model, and also different shrinkage parameters for the different response variables. This makes it possible for the model to adapt to varying degrees of nonlinearity in different parts of the data in a parsimonious way. Simulated data and an application to firm leverage data show that the approach is computationally efficient, and that allowing for freely estimated knot locations can offer a substantial improvement in out-of-sample predictive performance.},

@article{Tahmaseb2008,
abstract = {Purpose: To describe the use of a computer-aided three-dimensional planning protocol in combination with previously placed reference elements and computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology to restore the partially edentulous patient. Materials and Methods: Mini-implants and/or reference brackets were inserted or positioned in specified locations in a test cast and in two patients prior to imaging to act as definitive fiducial markers. This served as a fixed base to better define a setup for the fabrication of a surgical template used during computed tomographic imaging. A simulated partially edentulous maxilla was used for the study, and two partially edentulous patients participated. With the CT images, a CAD/CAM superstructure was created prior to surgery and inserted immediately after surgery. Fit of the prosthesis was assessed using three-dimensional tension measurements with strain gauges. Results: Mean misfit for all implants in the x-, y-, and z-axes was 26.6, 24.8, and 10.4 Μm, respectively. The total misfit calculated according to the Pythagorean theorem was 42.6 Μm. Conclusions: Based upon this pilot study in two patients and an in vitro analysis, it appears that the use of reproducible fiducial markers consisting of mini-implants and reference brackets results in the fabrication of an acceptably accurately fitting definitive prosthesis prior to implant placement.

@article{Taylor2004,
abstract = {Joint modelling of location and scale parameters has generally been confined to exponential families. In this paper the location and scale parameters of the t distribution are allowed to depend on covariates. The closed form of the likelihood allows inference to proceed in a similar fashion to the Gaussian location and scale model and provides a framework for a simple scoring algorithm to estimate the parameters. The algorithm includes a procedure to estimate the degrees of freedom parameter of the t distribution. Homogeneity and asymptotic tests are discussed and a methodology is derived to detect heteroscedasticity when the response is t distributed. Simulations reveal considerable bias in the estimates of the degrees of freedom parameter and only minor bias in the estimated fixed effects associated with the scale parameter. In comparison, the estimated location effects are well behaved. To illustrate the joint modelling of location and scale parameters of the t distribution the methodology is applied to two data sets.},

@article{George1993,
abstract = {A crucial problem in building a multiple regression model is the selection of predictors to include. The main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. This procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. In this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability-the promising ones-can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample.},

abstract = {The Jones calculus is a well known method for analyzing the polarization of a fully polarized beam. It deals with a beam having spatially homogeneous polarization. In recent years, axially symmetric polarized beams, where the polarization is not homogeneous in its cross section, have attracted great interest. In the present article, we show the formula for the rotation of beams and optical elements on the angularly variant term-added Jones calculus, which is required for analyzing axially symmetric beams. In addition, we introduce an extension of the Jones calculus: use of the polar coordinate basis. With this calculus, the representation of some angularly variant beams and optical elements are simplified and become intuitive. We show definitions, examples, and conversion formulas between different notations.},

It is found that the usual least squares coefficient estimate is the maximum likelihood estimate and the mean of the posterior distribution under a diffuse prior distribution. Inferences based on usual t- and F-statistics are shown valid for a range of error distributional assumptions including the multivariate-t assumption. Inferences about the scale parameter of the multivariate-t distribution can be made using an F-distribution rather than the usual 2 (or inverted 2) distribution.},
