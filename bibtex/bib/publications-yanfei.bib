  abstract     = {Forecast combinations have been widely applied in the last few decades
                  to improve forecasting. Estimating optimal weights that can outperform
                  simple averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of
                  using time series features for forecast combinations has
                  flourished. Although this idea has been proved to be beneficial in
                  several forecasting competitions, it may not be practical in many
                  situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate features to
                  build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an
                  acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated
                  based on the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the
                  future. Other times, the estimation of the features is infeasible due to
                  limited historical data. In this work, we suggest a change of focus from
                  the historical data to the produced forecasts to extract features. We
                  use out-of-sample forecasts to obtain weights for forecast combinations
                  by amplifying the diversity of the pool of methods being combined. A
                  rich set of time series is used to evaluate the performance of the
                  proposed method. Experimental results show that our diversity-based
                  forecast combination framework not only simplifies the modeling process
                  but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms of both
                  point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition
                  lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency,
                  elements that are important from both an optimization and a decision
                  analysis perspective.},

  abstract     = {Providing forecasts for ultra-long time series plays a vital role in
                  various activities, such as investment decisions, industrial production
                  arrangements, and farm management. This paper develops a novel
                  distributed forecasting framework to tackle challenges associated with
                  forecasting ultra-long time series by using the industry-standard
                  MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach facilitates
                  distributed time series forecasting by combining the local estimators of
                  time series models delivered from worker nodes and minimizing a global
                  loss function. In this way, instead of unrealistically assuming the data
                  generating process (DGP) of an ultra-long time series stays invariant,
                  we make assumptions only on the DGP of subseries spanning shorter time
                  periods. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach with
                  AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models using the real
                  data application as well as numerical simulations. Compared to directly
                  fitting the whole data with ARIMA models, our approach results in
                  improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency both in point
                  forecasts and prediction intervals, especially for longer forecast
                  horizons. Moreover, we explore some potential factors that may affect
                  the forecasting performance of our approach.},

                  with an efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach. The
                  minimum predicted forecast error is then used to identify an individual
                  model or a combination of models to produce the final forecasts. It is
                  well known that the performance of most meta-learning models depends on
                  the representativeness of the reference dataset used for training. In
                  such circumstances, we augment the reference dataset with a
                  feature-based time series simulation approach, namely GRATIS, to
                  generate a rich and representative time series collection. The proposed

                  challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise
                  risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting
                  applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle
                  real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of

                  wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles,
                  and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We

                  features, which is called Feature-based Bayesian Forecasting Model

                  combination via Bayesian log predictive scores, in which the optimal
                  forecasting combination is determined by time series features from
                  historical information. In particular, we use an automatic Bayesian
                  variable selection method to add weight to the importance of different
                  features. To this end, our approach has better interpretability compared

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting plays an increasingly important role in modern
                  business decisions. In today's data-rich environment, people often aim
                  to choose the optimal forecasting model for their data. However,
                  identifying the optimal model requires professional knowledge and
                  experience, making accurate forecasting a challenging task. To mitigate
                  the importance of model selection, we propose a simple and reliable
                  algorithm to improve the forecasting performance. Specifically, we
                  construct multiple time series with different sub-seasons from the
                  original time series. These derived series highlight different
                  sub-seasonal patterns of the original series, making it possible for the
                  forecasting methods to capture diverse patterns and components of the
                  data. Subsequently, we produce forecasts for these multiple series
                  separately with classical statistical models (ETS or ARIMA). Finally,
                  the forecasts are combined. We evaluate our approach on widely used
                  forecasting competition data sets (M1, M3, and M4) in terms of both
                  point forecasts and prediction intervals. We observe performance
                  improvements compared with the benchmarks. Our approach is particularly
                  suitable and robust for the data with higher frequency. To demonstrate
                  the practical value of our proposition, we showcase the performance

                  model for each time series. However, statistical models usually presume
                  some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the
                  errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach —
                  ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in
                  a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on
                  identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e.,
                  ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar
                  patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of
                  extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to
                  obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the
                  cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of
                  similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate
                  the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it
                  yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction
                  intervals.},

                  known as Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising
                  results in forecasting competitions and real-world applications,
                  outperforming many state-of-the-art univariate forecasting
                  techniques. In most cases, GFMs are implemented using deep neural
                  networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which
                  require a sufficient amount of time series to estimate their numerous
                  model parameters. However, many time series databases have only a
                  limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data
                  augmentation based forecasting framework that is capable of improving
                  the baseline accuracy of the GFM models in less data-abundant
                  settings. We use three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS,
                  moving block bootstrap (MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric
                  averaging (DBA) to synthetically generate a collection of time
                  series. The knowledge acquired from these augmented time series is then
                  transferred to the original dataset using two different approaches: the
                  pooled approach and the transfer learning approach. When building GFMs,
                  in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented time series
                  alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer
                  learning approach, we adapt a pre-trained model to the new dataset. In
                  our evaluation on competition and real-world time series datasets, our
                  proposed variants can significantly improve the baseline accuracy of GFM

                  attention in a wide range of time series analysis methods. Recently, the
                  use of time series features for forecast model averaging has been an
                  emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most
                  of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate
                  set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to extract features
                  from time series automatically becomes crucial in state-of-the-art time
                  series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to
                  extract time series features based on time series imaging. We first
                  transform time series into recurrence plots, from which local features
                  can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted
                  features are used for forecast model averaging. Our experiments show
                  that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less

                  is the possibility of forecasting the tail-dependences explicitly. Most

                  explicit functions of covariates, with the aim of improving the copula

                  introduce non-stationarity and intermittency to turbulent mixing, thus
                  invalidating the usual scaling laws and numerical model
                  parametrizations, but their characteristics and generating mechanisms
                  are still generally unknown. Detecting these unknown events from time
                  series requires techniques that do not assume particular geometries or
                  amplitudes of the flow structures. We use a recently developed such
                  method with some modifications to study the night-time structures over a
                  three-month period during the FLOSSII experiment. The structures cover
                  about 26\% of the dataset, and can be categorized using clustering into
                  only three classes with similar characteristics. The largest class,
                  including about 50\% of the events, contains smooth structures, often
                  with wave-like shapes, which occur in stronger winds and weak
                  stability. The second class, including sharper structures with large
                  kurtosis, is characterized by weaker winds and stronger stability. The
                  smallest class, including about 20\% of the events, contains
                  predominantly sharp step-like structures, or microfronts. They occur in
                  the weakest winds with strong stability. Sharper, and particularly
                  shallower, structures are related to transient low-level wind maxima
                  which create inflection points and may affect generation of
                  turbulence. Furthermore, large wind directional shear, which is another
                  source of transient inflection points, is generated even by deep
                  coherent structures when the background wind is weaker than the
                  structure intensity. These results show that the complexity of
                  structures can be reduced for the purpose of further analysis using a
                  proper classification. Mapping common characteristics of such events
                  leads to their better understanding, which, if combined with similar
                  analyses of other boundary-layer data, could lead to improving their

  abstract     = {A method for extracting and classifying shapes from noisy time series is
                  proposed. The method consists of two steps. The first step is to perform
                  a noise test on each subsequence extracted from the series using a
                  sliding window. All the subsequences recognised as noise are removed
                  from further analysis, and the shapes are extracted from the remaining
                  non-noise subsequences. The second step is to cluster these extracted
                  shapes. Although extracted from subsequences, these shapes form a
                  non-overlapping set of time series subsequences and are hence amenable
                  to meaningful clustering. The method is primarily designed for
                  extracting and classifying shapes from very noisy real-world time
                  series. Tests using artificial data with different levels of white noise
                  and the red noise, and the real-world atmospheric turbulence data
                  naturally characterised by strong red noise show that the method is able
                  to correctly extract and cluster shapes from artificial data and that it
                  has great potential for locating shapes in very noisy real-world time
                  series.},

  abstract     = {An unsupervised time series change detection method based on an
                  extension of Vector Quantization (VQ) clustering is proposed. The method
                  clusters the subsequences extracted with a sliding window in feature
                  space. Changes can be defined as transition of subsequences from one
                  cluster to another. The method can be used to achieve real time
                  detection of the change points in a time series. Using data on road

                  Difference Vegetation Index data and x simulated data. It is shown that
                  the detected changes coincide with identifiable political, historical,
                  environmental or simulated events that might have caused these
                  changes. Further, the online method has the potential for revealing the
                  insights into the nature of the changes and the transition behaviours of
                  the system.},
