  abstract = {Model selection has been proven an effective strategy for improving accuracy in time series forecasting applications. However, when dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting model, forecasters have also to select a suitable method for reconciling the base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent. Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting reconciliation method and leading to more accurate coherent forecasts. The approach, which we call conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on machine learning classification methods that use time series features to select the reconciliation method for each hierarchy. Moreover, it allows the selection to be tailored according to the accuracy measure of preference and the hierarchical level(s) of interest. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting can lead to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels.},

However, PLANET, the standard distributed tree learning algorithm implemented in systems such as XGBOOST and Spark MLLIB, scales poorly as data dimensionality and tree depths grow. We present YGGDRASIL, a new distributed tree learning method that outperforms existing methods by up to 24×. Unlike PLANET, YGGDRASIL is based on vertical partitioning of the data (i.e., partitioning by feature), along with a set of optimized data structures to reduce the CPU and communication costs of training. YGGDRASIL (1) trains directly on compressed data for compressible features and labels; (2) introduces efficient data structures for training on uncompressed data; and (3) minimizes communication between nodes by using sparse bitvectors. Moreover, while PLANET approximates split points through feature binning, YGGDRASIL does not require binning, and we analytically characterize the impact of this approximation. We evaluate YGGDRASIL against the MNIST 8M dataset and a high-dimensional dataset at Yahoo; for both, YGGDRASIL is faster by up to an order of magnitude.},

We estimate this model exploiting the municipality network and the roots of local state capacity related to the presence of the colonial state and royal roads. Our estimates indicate that local state capacity decisions are strategic complements. Spillover effects are sizable, accounting for about 50 percent of the quantitative impact of an expansion in local state capacity, but network effects driven by equilibrium responses of other municipalities are much larger.

We show that financial contagion exhibits a form of phase transition as interbank connections increase: as long as the magnitude and the number of negative shocks affecting financial institutions are sufficiently small, more “complete” interbank claims enhance the stability of the system. However, beyond a certain point, such interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for propagation of shocks and lead to a more fragile financial system. We also show that, under natural contracting assumptions, financial networks that emerge in equilibrium may be socially inefficient due to the presence of a network externality: even though banks take the effects of their lending, risk-taking and failure on their immediate creditors into account, they do not internalize the consequences of their actions on the rest of the network.},

  abstract = {We present Placeto, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to efficiently find device placements for distributed neural network training. Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1× fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.},

  abstract = {Topic models have proven to be a useful tool for discovering latent structures in document collections. However, most document collections often come as temporal streams and thus several aspects of the latent structure such as the number of topics, the topics’ distribution and popularity are time-evolving. Several models exist that model the evolution of some but not all of the above aspects. In this paper we introduce infinite dynamic topic models, iDTM, that can accommodate the evolution of all the aforementioned aspects. Our model assumes that documents are organized into epochs, where the documents within each epoch are exchangeable but the order between the documents is maintained across epochs. iDTM allows for unbounded number of topics: topics can die or be born at any epoch, and the representation of each topic can evolve according to a Markovian dynamics. We use iDTM to analyze the birth and evolution of topics in the NIPS community and evaluated the efficacy of our model on both simulated and real datasets with favorable outcome.},

An algorithm based on the Langevin equation with stochastic gradients (SGLD) was previously proposed to solve this, but its mixing rate was slow. By leveraging the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem, we extend the SGLD algorithm so that at high mixing rates it will sample from a normal approximation of the posterior, while for slow mixing rates it will mimic the behavior of SGLD with a pre-conditioner matrix. As a bonus, the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of Fisher scoring (with stochastic gradients) and as such an efficient optimizer during burn-in.},

When banks are subject to counterparty risk, by contrast, information contagion induces a large shift toward more prudential portfolios and therefore reduces systemic risk.},

  abstract = {State space models (SSMs) are a flexible approach to modeling complex time series. However, inference in SSMs is often computationally prohibitive for long time series. Stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) is a popular method for scalable Bayesian inference for large independent data. Unfortunately when applied to dependent data, such as in SSMs, SGMCMC’s stochastic gradient estimates are biased as they break crucial temporal dependencies. To alleviate this, we propose stochastic gradient estimators that control this bias by performing additional computation in a ‘buffer’ to reduce breaking dependencies. Furthermore, we derive error bounds for this bias and show a geometric decay under mild conditions. Using these estimators, we develop novel SGMCMC samplers for discrete, continuous and mixed-type SSMs with analytic message passing. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our SGMCMC algorithms compared to batch MCMC, allowing us to scale inference to long time series with millions of time points.},

Berger (2000) documents the increase in Bayesian activity by the number of published research articles, the number of books,andtheextensivenumberofapplicationsofBayesianarticlesinapplied disciplines such as science and engineering. One reason for the dramatic growth in Bayesian modeling is the availab- ity of computational algorithms to compute the range of integrals that are necessary in a Bayesian posterior analysis. Due to the speed of modern c- puters, it is now possible to use the Bayesian paradigm to ?t very complex models that cannot be ?t by alternative frequentist methods. To ?t Bayesian models, one needs a statistical computing environment. This environment should be such that one can: write short scripts to de?ne a Bayesian model use or write functions to summarize a posterior distribution use functions to simulate from the posterior distribution construct graphs to illustrate the posterior inference An environment that meets these requirements is the R system. R provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical d- plays. Moreover, it includes a well-developed, simple programming language that users can extend by adding new functions. Many such extensions of the language in the form of packages are easily downloadable from the Comp- hensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

  abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom levels. Then, hierarchical reconciliation can be used to improve the overall performance further. In this paper, we present a hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment approach that treats the bottom-level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach, N-BEATS, for continuous time series at the top levels, and a widely used tree-based algorithm, LightGBM, for intermittent time series at the bottom level. The hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment approach is a simple yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business orientated and can be used to facilitate strategic business planning.},

In this work, we propose the GAN-based method for automatic face aging. Contrary to previous works employing GANs for altering of facial attributes, we make a particular emphasize on preserving the original person’s identity in the aged version of his/her face. To this end, we introduce a novel approach for “Identity-Preserving” optimization of GAN’s latent vectors. The objective evaluation of the resulting aged and rejuvenated face images by the state-of-theart face recognition and age estimation solutions demonstrate the high potential of the proposed method.},

Based on this evidence, I summarize the progress made over the past quarter century with respect to methods for reducing forecasting error. Seven well-established methods have been shown to improve accuracy: combining forecasts and Delphi help for all types of data; causal modeling, judgmental bootstrapping and structured judgment help with cross-sectional data; and causal models and trend-damping help with time series data. Promising methods for cross-sectional data include damped causality, simulated interaction, structured analogies, and judgmental decomposition; for time series data, they include segmentation, rule-based forecasting, damped seasonality, decomposition by causal forces, damped trend with analogous data, and damped seasonality. The testing of multiple hypotheses has also revealed methods where gains are limited: these include data mining, neural nets, and Box–Jenkins methods. Multiple hypotheses tests should be conducted on widely used but relatively untested methods such as prediction markets, conjoint analysis, diffusion models, and game theory.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new univariate forecasting method. The method is based on the concept of modifying the local curvature of the time-series through a coefficient 'Theta' (the Greek letter u), that is applied directly to the second differences of the data. The resulting series that are created maintain the mean and the slope of the original data but not their curvatures. These new time series are named Theta-lines. Their primary qualitative characteristic is the improvement of the approximation of the long-term behavior of the data or the augmentation of the short-term features, depending on the value of the Theta coefficient. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into two or more different Theta-lines. These are extrapolated separately and the subsequent forecasts are combined. The simple combination of two Theta-lines, the Theta 5 0 (straight line) and Theta 5 2 (double local curves) was adopted in order to produce forecasts for the 3003 series of the M3 competition. The method performed well, particularly for monthly series and for microeconomic data.},

Exploiting inherent aggregation structures of such variables, we apply forecast reconciliation methods to generate forecasts that are coherent with the aggregation constraints.

Our approach approximates full posterior distributions over model parameters and structures, as well as latent variables, in an analytical manner. These posteriors fall out of a free-form optimization procedure, which naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally nonGaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization methods are often used to optimize unknown functions that are costly to evaluate. Typically, these methods sequentially select inputs to be evaluated one at a time based on a posterior over the unknown function that is updated after each evaluation. In many applications, however, it is desirable to perform multiple evaluations in parallel, which requires selecting batches of multiple inputs to evaluate at once. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to batch Bayesian optimization, providing a policy for selecting batches of inputs with the goal of optimizing the function as efficiently as possible. The key idea is to exploit the availability of high-quality and efficient sequential policies, by using Monte-Carlo simulation to select input batches that closely match their expected behavior. Our experimental results on six benchmarks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms two baselines and can lead to large advantages over a top sequential approach in terms of performance per unit time.},

  abstract = {Spare parts are often associated with intermittent demand patterns that render their forecasting a challenging task. Forecasting of spare parts demand has been researched through both parametric and non-parametric approaches. However, little has been contributed in this area from a Bayesian perspective, and most of such research is built around the Poisson demand distributional assumption. However, the Poisson distribution is known to have certain limitations and, further, empirical evidence on the inventory performance of Bayesian methods is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian method based on compound Poisson distributions. The proposed method is compared to the Poisson-based Bayesian method with a Gamma prior distribution as well as to a parametric frequentist method and to a non-parametric one. A numerical investigation (on 7400 theoretically generated series) is complemented by an empirical assessment on demand data from about 3000 stock keeping units in the automotive sector to analyse the performance of the four forecasting methods. We find that both Bayesian methods outperform the other methods with a higher inventory efficiency reported for the Poisson Bayesian method with a Gamma prior. This outperformance increases for higher demand variability. From a practical perspective, the outperformance of the proposed method is associated with some added complexity. We also find that the performance of the non-parametric method improves for longer lead-times and higher demand variability when compared to the parametric one.},

  abstract = {Social networks can shape many aspects of social and economic activity: migration and trade, job-seeking, innovation, consumer preferences and sentiment, public health, social mobility, and more. In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook’s scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook’s user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

  abstract = {Background Firearm-related death rates and years of potential life lost (YPLL) vary widely between population subgroups and states. However, changes or inflections in temporal trends within subgroups and states are not fully documented. We assessed temporal patterns and inflections in the rates of firearm deaths and \%YPLL due to firearms for overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, intent, and states in the United States between 1999 and 2016. Methods We extracted age-adjusted firearm mortality and YPLL rates per 100,000, and \%YPLL from 1999 to 2016 by using the WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. We used Joinpoint Regression to assess temporal trends, the inflection points, and annual percentage change (APC) from 1999 to 2016. Results National firearm mortality rates were 10.3 and 11.8 per 100,000 in 1999 and 2016, with two distinct segments; a plateau until 2014 followed by an increase of APC = 7.2\% (95\% CI 3.1, 11.4). YPLL rates were from 304.7 and 338.2 in 1999 and 2016 with a steady APC increase in \%YPLL of 0.65\% (95\% CI 0.43, 0.87) from 1999 to an inflection point in 2014, followed by a larger APC in \%YPLL of 5.1\% (95\% CI 0.1, 10.4). The upward trend in firearm mortality and YPLL rates starting in 2014 was observed in subgroups of male, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanic whites and for firearm assaults. The inflection points for firearm mortality and YPLL rates also varied across states. Conclusions Within the United States, firearm mortality rates and YPLL remained constant between 1999 and 2014 and has been increasing subsequently. There was, however, an increase in firearm mortality rates in several subgroups and individual states earlier than 2014.},

Along with the temporal and spatial features of fMRI data, this artifact raises a challenging problem in the statistical analysis. In this paper, we introduce a supervised singular value decomposition technique as a data reduction step of independent component analysis (ICA), which is an effective tool for exploring spatio-temporal features in fMRI data. Two major advantages are discussed: first, the proposed method improves the robustness of ICA against spikes; second, the method uses the fMRI experimental designs to guide the fully data-driven ICA, yielding a more computationally efficient procedure and highly interpretable results. The advantages are demonstrated using spatio-temporal simulation studies as well as a data analysis.},

  abstract = {It is well known that Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods scale poorly with dataset size. A popular class of methods for solving this issue is stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC). These methods use a noisy estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior, which reduces the per iteration computational cost of the algorithm. Despite this, there are a number of results suggesting that stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), probably the most popular of these methods, still has computational cost proportional to the dataset size. We suggest an alternative log-posterior gradient estimate for stochastic gradient MCMC which uses control variates to reduce the variance. We analyse SGLD using this gradient estimate, and show that, under log-concavity assumptions on the target distribution, the computational cost required for a given level of accuracy is independent of the dataset size. Next, we show that a different control-variate technique, known as zero variance control variates, can be applied to SGMCMC algorithms for free. This postprocessing step improves the inference of the algorithm by reducing the variance of the MCMC output. Zero variance control variates rely on the gradient of the log-posterior; we explore how the variance reduction is affected by replacing this with the noisy gradient estimate calculated by SGMCMC.},

  abstract = {Classification of time series is a growing problem in different disciplines due to the progressive digitalization of the world. Currently, the state of the art in time series classification is dominated by Collective of Transformation-Based Ensembles. This algorithm is composed of several classifiers of diverse nature that are combined according to their results in an internal cross validation procedure. Its high complexity prevents it from being applied to large datasets. One Nearest Neighbours with Dynamic Time Warping remains the base classifier in any time series classification problem, for its simplicity and good results. Despite their good performance, they share a weakness, which is that they are not interpretable. In the field of time series classification, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a set of characteristics capable of extracting information of the structure of the time series in order to face time series classification problems. The use of these characteristics allows the use of traditional classification algorithms in time series problems. The experimental results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of the results obtained by our proposal with respect to the original time series. Apart from the improvement in accuracy, our proposal is able to offer interpretable results based on the set of characteristics proposed.},

Next, these forecasts are extended to allow for various ARMA type structure on the disturbances, as well as spatial autoregressive and moving average type disturbances. These forecasting methods are then studied in the context of seemingly unrelated regressions. We highlight several forecasting empirical applications using panel data, as well as several Monte Carlo studies that compare various forecasting methods using panel data.

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are widely used in nonparametric regression, classification and spatiotemporal modelling, facilitated in part by a rich literature on their theoretical properties. However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-ofregressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.},

  abstract = {The Makridakis Competitions seek to identify the most accurate forecasting methods for different types of predictions. The M4 competition was the first in which a model of the type commonly described as ‘‘machine learning’’ has outperformed the more traditional statistical approaches, winning the competition. However, many approaches that were self-labeled as ‘‘machine learning’’ failed to produce accurate results, which generated discussion about the respective benefits and drawbacks of ‘‘statistical’’ and ‘‘machine learning’’ approaches. Both terms have remained ill-defined in the context of forecasting. This paper introduces the terms ‘‘structured’’ and ‘‘unstructured’’ models to better define what is intended by the use of the terms ‘‘statistical’’ and ‘‘machine learning’’ in the context of forecasting based on the model’s data generating process. The mechanisms that underlie specific challenges to unstructured modeling are examined in the context of forecasting, along with common solutions. Finally, the innovations in the winning model that allowed it to overcome these challenges and produce highly accurate results are highlighted.},

The random probability measures are constructed by a hierarchy of generalized species sampling processes with possibly non-diffuse base measures. The proposed framework provides a probabilistic foundation for hierarchical random measures, and allows for studying their properties under the alternative assumptions of diffuse, atomic and mixed base measure. We show that hierarchical species sampling models have a Chinese Restaurants Franchise representation and can be used as prior distributions to undertake Bayesian nonparametric inference. We provide a general sampling method for posterior approximation which easily accounts for non-diffuse base measures such as spike-and-slab.},

  abstract = {Communication bottleneck has been identified as a significant issue in distributed optimization of large-scale learning models. Recently, several approaches to mitigate this problem have been proposed, including different forms of gradient compression or computing local models and mixing them iteratively. In this paper we propose Qsparse-local-SGD algorithm, which combines aggressive sparsification with quantization and local computation along with error compensation, by keeping track of the difference between the true and compressed gradients. We propose both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of Qsparselocal-SGD. We analyze convergence for Qsparse-local-SGD in the distributed case, for smooth non-convex and convex objective functions. We demonstrate that Qsparse-local-SGD converges at the same rate as vanilla distributed SGD for many important classes of sparsifiers and quantizers. We use Qsparse-local-SGD to train ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and show that it results in significant savings over the state-of-the-art, in the number of bits transmitted to reach target accuracy.},

In a unified likelihood based framework, we propose new test statistics and point estimators obtained by aggregating various statistics from k subsamples of size n/k, where n is the sample size. In both low dimensional and high dimensional settings, we address the important question of how to choose k as n grows large, providing a theoretical upper bound on k such that the information loss due to the divide and conquer algorithm is negligible. In other words, the resulting estimators have the same inferential efficiencies and estimation rates as a practically infeasible oracle with access to the full sample.

The results demonstrate that no country and sector was immune to the adverse effects of the crisis limiting the effectiveness of portfolio diversification. However, there is clear evidence that some sectors in particular Healthcare, Telecommunications and Technology were less severely affected by the crisis.},

Using a regional climate model and a cyclone-tracking algorithm, we study how idealized deforestation and afforestation of Europe affect long-term changes in the number and intensity of cyclones, and their effects on precipitation. The number of cyclones over Europe is smaller for afforestation compared to deforestation, with differences starting from 10\% in regions near the west European coast and increasing towards the east to reach 80\%. This decrease is caused by the larger surface roughness in afforestation. The winter precipitation extremes are considerably reduced with afforestation, without a large decrease in mean precipitation because of the balancing effect of increased weak and moderate precipitation. The mean precipitation increases over central and southern Europe as a result of the summer precipitation increase caused by larger evapotranspiration and access to deeper soil moisture in the presence of trees. These different region-specific effects of afforestation are generally positive and could provide an important mitigation tool in a changing climate.},

For sample sizes of 10 to 50, I examined the performance of methods for adjusting confidence intervals of the mean and parameters of a linear regression for autocorrelation. Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95\% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals. Cautious interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is recommended.},

The data available consisted of the hourly loads for the 20 zones and hourly temperatures from 11 weather stations, for four and a half years. For each zone, the hourly electricity loads for nine different weeks needed to be predicted without having the locations of either the zones or stations. We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand. Team TinTin ranked fifth out of 105 participating teams.},

  abstract = {We study the Bayesian density estimation of data living in the offset of an unknown submanifold of the Euclidean space. In this perspective, we introduce a new notion of anisotropic H¨older for the underlying density and obtain posterior rates that are minimax optimal and adaptive to the regularity of the density, to the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, and to the size of the offset, provided that the latter is not too small — while still allowed to go to zero. Our Bayesian procedure, based on location-scale mixtures of Gaussians, appears to be convenient to implement and yields good practical results, even for quite singular data.},

  abstract = {The complete final product of Bayesian inference is the posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. Important inference summaries include point estimation, region estimation, and precise hypotheses testing. Those summaries may appropriately be described as the solution to specific decision problems which depend on the particular loss function chosen. The use of a continuous loss function leads to an integrated set of solutions where the same prior distribution may be used throughout. Objective Bayesian methods are those which use a prior distribution which only depends on the assumed model and the quantity of interest. As a consequence, objective Bayesian methods produce results which only depend on the assumed model and the data obtained. The combined use of the intrinsic discrepancy, an invariant information-based loss function, and appropriately defined reference priors, provides an integrated objective Bayesian solution to both estimation and hypothesis testing problems. The ideas are illustrated with a large collection of non-trivial examples.},

For dense matrices, we present those schemes that yield the complete decomposition, whereas for sparse matrices we describe schemes that yield only the extremal singular triplets. Special attention is devoted to the computation of the smallest singular values which are normally the most difficult to evaluate but which provide a measure of the distance to singularity of the matrix under consideration. Also, we conclude with the presentation of a parallel method for computing pseudospectra, which depends on computing the smallest singular values.},

Focusing on the multi-step-ahead forecasting of daily sales of many supermarket items, we adapt dynamic count mixture models for forecasting individual customer transactions, and introduce novel dynamic binary cascade models for predicting counts of items per transaction. These transaction–sales models can incorporate time-varying trends, seasonality, price, promotion, random effects and other outlet-specific predictors for individual items. Sequential Bayesian analysis involves fast, parallel filtering on sets of decoupled items, and is adaptable across items that may exhibit widely-varying characteristics. A multi-scale approach enables information to be shared across items with related patterns over time in order to improve prediction, while maintaining the scalability to many items. A motivating case study in many-item, multi-period, multi-step-ahead supermarket sales forecasting provides examples that demonstrate an improved forecast accuracy on multiple metrics, and illustrates the benefits of full probabilistic models for forecast accuracy evaluation and comparison.},

  abstract = {Penalized regression methods, such as L1 regularization, are routinely used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on optimality properties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm, sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians, facilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the corresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide precise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we demonstrate that most commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, are suboptimal in high-dimensional settings. A new class of Dirichlet Laplace (DL) priors are proposed, which are optimal and lead to efficient posterior computation exploiting results from normalized random measure theory. Finite sample performance of Dirichlet Laplace priors relative to alternatives is assessed in simulations.},

  abstract = {Shrinkage for time-varying parameter (TVP) models is investigated within a Bayesian framework, with the aim to automatically reduce time-varying parameters to static ones, if the model is overfitting. This is achieved through placing the double gamma shrinkage prior on the process variances. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme is developed, exploiting boosting based on the ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy. The method is applicable both to TVP models for univariate as well as multivariate time series. Applications include a TVP generalized Phillips curve for EU area inflation modeling and a multivariate TVP Cholesky stochastic volatility model for joint modeling of the returns from the DAX-30 index.},

We take a Bayesian approach, generating an appropriate prior via a distribution on partitions that we refer to as the nested Chinese restaurant process. This nonparametric prior allows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation. We illustrate our approach on simulated data and with an application to the modeling of NIPS abstracts.},

  abstract = {Clustering multivariate time series is a critical task in many real-world applications involving multiple signals and sensors. Existing systems aim to maximize effectiveness, efficiency and scalability, but fail to guarantee the interpretability of the results. This hinders their application in critical real scenarios where human comprehension of algorithmic behavior is required. This paper introduces Time2Feat, an end-to-end machine learning system for multivariate time series (MTS) clustering. The system relies on inter-signal and intra-signal interpretable features extracted from the time series. Then, a dimensionality reduction technique is applied to select a subset of features that retain most of the information, thus enhancing the interpretability of the results. In addition, domain experts can semi-supervise the process, by providing a small amount of MTS with a target cluster. This process further improves both accuracy and interpretability, narrowing down the number of features used by the clustering process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, interpretability, efficiency, and robustness of Time2Feat through experiments on eighteen benchmarking time series datasets, comparing them with state-of-the-art MTS clustering methods.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether a party to a strategic alliance or joint venture suffers from spillover effects when the other partner files for bankruptcy. We find that the nonbankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm’s bankruptcy filing announcement. This negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. Furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. Non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. There is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm.},

In the distributed sparse Gaussian mean estimation problem, each of the m machines receives n data points from a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with unknown mean θ which is promised to be k-sparse. The machines communicate by message passing and aim to estimate the mean θ. We provide a tight (up to logarithmic factors) tradeoff between the estimation error and the number of bits communicated between the machines. This directly leads to a lower bound for the distributed sparse linear regression problem: to achieve the statistical minimax error, the total communication is at least Ω(min\{n, d\}m), where n is the number of observations that each machine receives and d is the ambient dimension. These lower bound results improve upon Shamir (NIPS’14) and Steinhardt, Duchi (COLT’15) by allowing a multi-round interactive communication model. We also give the first optimal simultaneous protocol in the dense case for mean estimation.},

These series are linked by hierarchical constraints—global consumption is the sum of regional consumption, for example. First, benchmark forecasts are generated for all series using generalized additive models. Second, for each series, the aggregation algorithm ML-Poly, introduced by Gaillard, Stoltz, and van Erven in 2014, finds an optimal linear combination of the benchmarks. Finally, the forecasts are projected onto a coherent subspace to ensure that the final forecasts satisfy the hierarchical constraints. By minimizing a regret criterion, we show that the aggregation and projection steps improve the root mean square error of the forecasts. Our approach is tested on household electricity consumption data; experimental results suggest that successive aggregation and projection steps improve the benchmark forecasts at different levels of household aggregation.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments—active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning—and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

To this end, we train Generative Adversarial Networks at the largest scale yet attempted, and study the instabilities specific to such scale. We find that applying orthogonal regularization to the generator renders it amenable to a simple “truncation trick,” allowing fine control over the trade-off between sample fidelity and variety by reducing the variance of the Generator’s input. Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of the art in class-conditional image synthesis. When trained on ImageNet at 128×128 resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of 166.5 and Fre´chet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.4, improving over the previous best IS of 52.52 and FID of 18.65.},

  abstract = {Since their popularization in the 1990s, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have revolutionized statistical computing and have had an especially profound impact on the practice of Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, MCMC methods have enabled the development and use of intricate models in an astonishing array of disciplines as diverse as fisheries science and economics. The wide-ranging practical importance of MCMC has sparked an expansive and deep investigation into fundamental Markov chain theory.The Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo provides a reference for the broad audience of developers and users of MCMC methodology interested in keeping up with cutting-edge theory and applications. The first half of the book covers MCMC foundations, methodology, and algorithms. The second half considers the use of MCMC in a variety of practical applications including in educational research, astrophysics, brain imaging, ecology, and sociology.The in-depth introductory section of the book allows graduate students and practicing scientists new to MCMC to become thoroughly acquainted with the basic theory, algorithms, and applications. The book supplies detailed examples and case studies of realistic scientific problems presenting the diversity of methods used by the wide-ranging MCMC community. Those familiar with MCMC methods will find this book a useful refresher of current theory and recent developments.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating Bayesian hierarchical models when the number of cross-sectional units is very large and the objects of interest are the unit-level parameters. The two-stage algorithm is asymptotically exact, retains the flexibility of a standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The algorithm constructs an estimator of the posterior predictive distribution of the unit-level parameters in the first stage, and uses the estimator as the prior distribution in the second stage for the unit-level draws. Both stages are embarrassingly parallel. The algorithm is demonstrated with simulated data from a hierarchical logit model and is shown to be faster and more efficient (in effective sample size generated per unit of computing) than a single machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. For a relatively small number of observations per crosssectional unit, the algorithm is both faster and has better mixing properties than the standard hybrid Gibbs sampler. We illustrate our approach with data on 1,100,000 donors to a charitable organization, and simulations with up to 100 million units.},

We find that when the shock distribution displays “fat” tails, extreme segmentation into small components is optimal, while minimal segmentation and high density of connections are optimal when the distribution exhibits “thin” tails. For less regular distributions, intermediate degrees of segmentation and sparser connections are optimal. Also, if firms are heterogeneous, optimality requires perfect assortativity in a component. In general, however, a conflict arises between efficiency and pairwise stability, due to a “size externality” not internalized by firms.},

Similar as the low rank approximations, which seeks to approximate a given matrix by the sum of a few rank1 matrices, we propose to use the approximation by the sum of a few Kronecker products, which we refer to as the Kronecker product approximation (KoPA). Although it can be transformed into an SVD problem, KoPA offers a greater flexibility over low rank approximation, since it allows the user to choose the configuration of the Kronecker product. On the other hand, the configuration (the dimensions of the two smaller matrices forming the Kronecker product) to be used is usually unknown, and has to be determined from the data in order to obtain optimal balance between accuracy and complexity. We propose to use an extended information criterion to select the configuration. Under the paradigm of high dimensionality, we show that the proposed procedure is able to select the true configuration with probability tending to one, under suitable conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate the performance and superiority of KoPA over the low rank approximations thought numerical studies, and a real example in image analysis.},

To test the model, we analyze all global financial firms with traded options in the US and focus on the subprime mortgage crisis period. We compare the performance of the implied probability of default from our model to the expected default frequencies based on the Moody’s KMV model and agency credit ratings by constructing cumulative accuracy profiles (CAP) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We find that the probability of default estimates from our model are equal or superior to other credit risk measures studied based on CAP and ROC. In particular, during the subprime crisis our model surpassed credit ratings and matched or exceeded KMV in anticipating the magnitude of the crisis. We have also found some initial evidence that adding off-balance-sheet derivatives exposure improves the performance of the KMV model.},

  abstract = {Due to the growth of modern dataset size and the desire to harness computing power of multiple machines, there is a recent surge of interest in the design of distributed machine learning algorithms. However, distributed algorithms are sensitive to Byzantine attackers who can send falsified data to prevent the convergence of algorithms or lead the algorithms to converge to value of the attackers’ choice. Some recent work proposed interesting algorithms that can deal with the scenario when up to half of the workers are compromised. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can deal with an arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers. The main idea is to ask the parameter server to randomly select a small clean dataset and compute noisy gradient using this small dataset. This noisy gradient will then be used as a ground truth to filter out information sent by compromised workers. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to the neighborhood of the population minimizer regardless the number of Byzantine attackers. We further provide numerical examples to show that the proposed algorithm can benefit from the presence of good workers and achieve better performance than existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {In Bayesian density estimation, a question of interest is how the number of components in a finite mixture model grows with the number of observations. We provide a novel perspective on this question by using results from stochastic geometry to find that the growth rate of the expected number of components of a finite mixture model whose components belong to the unit simplex ∆J´1 of the Euclidean space RJ is plog nqJ´1. We also provide a central limit theorem for the number of components. In addition, we relate our model to a classical non-parametric density estimator based on a Pólya tree. Combining this latter with techniques from Choquet theory, we are able to retrieve mixture weights. We also give the rate of convergence of the Pólya tree posterior to the Dirac measure on the weights. The analyses in this paper apply to the well developed and popular latent Dirichlet allocation model.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to variable selection in regression is a powerful tool for tackling many scientific problems. Inference for variable selection models is usually implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Because MCMC can impose a high computational cost in studies with a large number of variables, we assess an alternative to MCMC based on a simple variational approximation. Our aim is to retain useful features of Bayesian variable selection at a reduced cost. Using simulations designed to mimic genetic association studies, we show that this simple variational approximation yields posterior inferences in some settings that closely match exact values. In less restrictive (and more realistic) conditions, we show that posterior probabilities of inclusion for individual variables are often incorrect, but variational estimates of other useful quantities—including posterior distributions of the hyperparameters—are remarkably accurate. We illustrate how these results guide the use of variational inference for a genome-wide association study with thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables.},

  abstract = {A drawback of available portfolio credit risk models is that they fail to allow for default risk dependency across loans other than through common risk factors. Thereby, these models ignore that close ties can exist between companies due to legal, financial and business relations. In this paper, we integrate the insights from theoretical models of default correlation into a commonly used model of default and portfolio credit risk by explicitly allowing for dependencies between firm defaults through both common factors and industry specific disturbances in a duration model. An application using pooled data from two Swedish banks’ business loan portfolios over the period 1994-2000 shows that estimates of individual default risk are little affected by including industry specific errors. However, accounting for the within-industry correlation of defaults increases estimates of VaR by 50-200 percent. We show that the model we propose manages to follow both the trend in credit losses and produce industry driven, time-varying, fluctuations in losses around that trend. A conventional model that contains only systematic factors as drivers of default correlation, although able to fit the broad trends in credit losses, cannot match these fluctuations because it fails to capture credit losses in bad times, when banks are typically hit by large unexpected credit losses. The model developed here should thus aid banks and supervisors in determining the appropriate size of economic capital requirements. Our estimations show that it is likely that banks need larger capital buffers than conventional models indicate.},

Yet, there are no papers that provide a general solution for combining these features, due to computational complexity. Moreover, homoskedastic Bayesian VARs for large data sets so far restrict substantially the allowed prior distributions on the parameters. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure for (possibly very large) VARs featuring time-varying volatilities and general priors. We show that indeed empirically the new estimation procedure performs well in applications to both structural analysis and out-of-sample forecasting.},

Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time.},

  abstract = {Forecasting is an important task across several domains. Its generalised interest is related to the uncertainty and complex evolving structure of time series. Forecasting methods are typically designed to cope with temporal dependencies among observations, but it is widely accepted that none is universally applicable. Therefore, a common solution to these tasks is to combine the opinion of a diverse set of forecasts. In this paper we present an approach based on arbitrating, in which several forecasting models are dynamically combined to obtain predictions. Arbitrating is a metalearning approach that combines the output of experts according to predictions of the loss that they will incur. We present an approach for retrieving out-of-bag predictions that significantly improves its data efficiency. Finally, since diversity is a fundamental component in ensemble methods, we propose a method for explicitly handling the inter-dependence between experts when aggregating their predictions. Results from extensive empirical experiments provide evidence of the method’s competitiveness relative to state of the art approaches. The proposed method is publicly available in a software package.},

  abstract = {This important text and reference for researchers and students in machine learning, game theory, statistics and information theory offers a comprehensive treatment of the problem of predicting individual sequences. Unlike standard statistical approaches to forecasting, prediction of individual sequences does not impose any probabilistic assumption on the data-generating mechanism. Yet, prediction algorithms can be constructed that work well for all possible sequences, in the sense that their performance is always nearly as good as the best forecasting strategy in a given reference class. The central theme is the model of prediction using expert advice, a general framework within which many related problems can be cast and discussed. Repeated game playing, adaptive data compression, sequential investment in the stock market, sequential pattern analysis, and several other problems are viewed as instances of the experts' framework and analyzed from a common nonstochastic standpoint that often reveals new and intriguing connections.},

The proposed methodology is motivated by a study of bird vocalizations in the Amazon rain forest; the timings of vocalizations exhibit self-similarity and long range dependence ruling out models based on Poisson processes. The proposed class of FRActional Probit (FRAP) models is based on thresholding of a latent process consisting of an additive expansion of a smooth Gaussian process with a fractional Brownian motion. We develop a Bayesian approach to inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and show good performance in simulation studies. Applying the methods to the Amazon bird vocalization data, we find substantial evidence for self-similarity and non-Markovian/Poisson dynamics. To accommodate the bird vocalization data, in which there are many different species of birds exhibiting their own vocalization dynamics, a hierarchical expansion of FRAP is provided in Supplementary Materials.},

Such a framework is useful for deriving all existing results with ease. In addition, it also provides insights into two forecast combination puzzles. Specifically, it investigates why a simple average of forecasts often outperforms forecasts from single models in terms of MSFEs, and why a more complicated weighting scheme does not always perform better than a simple average. In addition, this paper presents two new findings that are particularly relevant in practice. First, the MSFE of a forecast combination decreases as the number of models increases. Second, the conventional approach to the selection of optimal models, based on a simple comparison of MSFEs without further statistical testing, leads to a biased selection.},

  abstract = {Learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequences is a notoriously difficult task. There are three major challenges: 1) complex dependencies, 2) vanishing and exploding gradients, and 3) efficient parallelization. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective RNN connection structure, the DILATEDRNN, which simultaneously tackles all of these challenges. The proposed architecture is characterized by multi-resolution dilated recurrent skip connections, and can be combined flexibly with diverse RNN cells. Moreover, the DILATEDRNN reduces the number of parameters needed and enhances training efficiency significantly, while matching state-of-the-art performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term dependencies. To provide a theory-based quantification of the architecture’s advantages, we introduce a memory capacity measure, the mean recurrent length, which is more suitable for RNNs with long skip connections than existing measures. We rigorously prove the advantages of the DILATEDRNN over other recurrent neural architectures. The code for our method is publicly available1.},

For data from an observational study where the explanatory variables and response variables are measured over sampling units, we propose a vine copula regression method that uses regular vines and handles mixed continuous and discrete variables. This method can efficiently compute the conditional distribution of the response variable given the explanatory variables. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic conditional cumulative distribution function and quantile functions arising from vine copulas. Assuming all variables have been transformed to standard normal, the conditional quantile function could be asymptotically linear, sublinear, or constant with respect to the explanatory variables in different extreme directions, depending on the dependence properties of bivariate copulas in joint tails. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulated data sets and a real data set. The experiments demonstrate that the vine copula regression method is superior to linear regression in making inferences with conditional heteroscedasticity.},

  abstract = {We consider Bayesian empirical likelihood estimation and develop an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. The method proposed uses hitherto unknown properties of the gradient of the underlying log-empirical-likelihood function. We use results from convex analysis to show that these properties hold under minimal assumptions on the parameter space, prior density and the functions used in the estimating equations determining the empirical likelihood. Our method employs a finite number of estimating equations and observations but produces valid semiparametric inference for a large class of statistical models including mixed effects models, generalized linear models and hierarchical Bayes models. We overcome major challenges posed by complex, non-convex boundaries of the support routinely observed for empirical likelihood which prevent efficient implementation of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods like randomwalk Metropolis–Hastings sampling etc. with or without parallel tempering. A simulation study confirms that our method converges quickly and draws samples from the posterior support efficiently. We further illustrate its utility through an analysis of a discrete data set in small area estimation.},

  abstract = {We formulate a new inference task in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), called Variable Subset Forecast (VSF), where only a small subset of the variables is available during inference. Variables are absent during inference because of longterm data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high→low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been studied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the performance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF setting. We propose a non-parametric, wrapper technique that can be applied on top any existing forecast models. Through systematic experiments across 4 datasets and 5 forecast models, we show that our technique is able to recover close to 95\% performance of the models even when only 15\% of the original variables are present.},

We explore this relationship by applying simulated annealing to an SG-MCMC algorithm. Furthermore, we extend recent SG-MCMC methods with two key components: i) adaptive preconditioners (as in ADAgrad or RMSprop), and ii) adaptive element-wise momentum weights. The zero-temperature limit gives a novel stochastic optimization method with adaptive element-wise momentum weights, while conventional optimization methods only have a shared, static momentum weight. Under certain assumptions, our theoretical analysis suggests the proposed simulated annealing approach converges close to the global optima. Experiments on several deep neural network models show state-of-the-art results compared to related stochastic optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {In finance, economics and many other fields, observations in a matrix form are often generated over time. For example, a set of key economic indicators are regularly reported in different countries every quarter. The observations at each quarter neatly form a matrix and are observed over many consecutive quarters. Dynamic transport networks with observations generated on the edges can be formed as a matrix observed over time. Although it is natural to turn the matrix observations into a long vector, and then use the standard vector time series models for analysis, it is often the case that the columns and rows of the matrix represent different types of structures that are closely interplayed. In this paper we follow the autoregressive structure for modeling time series and propose a novel matrix autoregressive model in a bilinear form that maintains and utilizes the matrix structure to achieve a greater dimensional reduction, as well as more interpretable results. Probabilistic properties of the models are investigated. Estimation procedures with their theoretical properties are presented and demonstrated with simulated and real examples.},

However, the volume and velocity of big data make the estimation of quantile regression model extremely difficult due to the intensive computation and the limited storage. Based on divide and conquer strategy, a simple and efficient method is proposed to address this problem. The proposed approach only keeps summary statistics of each data block and then can use them to reconstruct the estimator of the entire data with asymptotically negligible approximation error. This property makes the proposed method particularly appealing when data blocks are retained in multiple servers or come in the form of data stream. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically as efficient as the estimating equation estimator calculated using the entire data together when certain conditions hold. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated using both simulation studies and real data analysis.},

  abstract = {Time series prediction has been a long-standing research topic and an essential application in many domains. Modern time series collected from sensor networks (e.g., energy consumption and traffic flow) are often large-scale and incomplete with considerable corruption and missing values, making it difficult to perform accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a low-rank autoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework to model multivariate time series data. The key of LATC is to transform the original multivariate time series matrix (e.g., sensor×time point) to a third-order tensor structure (e.g., sensor×time of day×day) by introducing an additional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms and seasonality of time series as global patterns. With the tensor structure, we can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation problems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides minimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the original matrix representation into the objective function. The two components serve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture the global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e., similarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s. the same time of historical days). The autoregressive norm can better model the local temporal trends. Our numerical experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the integration of global and local trends in LATC in both missing data imputation and rolling prediction tasks.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), which involves a central controller and a group of learners. In particular, two DRL settings encountered in several applications are considered: multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and parallel RL, where frequent information exchanges between the learners and the controller are required. For many practical distributed systems, however, such as those involving parallel machines for training deep RL algorithms, and multi-robot systems for learning the optimal coordination strategies, the overhead caused by these frequent communication exchanges is considerable, and becomes the bottleneck of the overall performance. To address this challenge, a novel policy gradient method is developed here to cope with such communicationconstrained DRL settings. The proposed approach reduces the communication overhead without degrading learning performance by adaptively skipping the policy gradient communication during iterations. It is established analytically that i) the novel algorithm has convergence rate identical to that of the plain-vanilla policy gradient for DRL; while ii) if the distributed computing units are heterogeneous in terms of their reward functions and initial state distributions, the number of communication rounds needed to achieve a desirable learning accuracy is markedly reduced. Numerical experiments on a popular multi-agent RL benchmark corroborate the significant communication reduction attained by the novel algorithm compared to alternatives.},

We introduce a communication-efficient distributed algorithm to estimate the rank-deficient loading matrix in reduced rank regressions. The distributed algorithm, which proceeds iteratively, reduces the computational complexity substantially. During each iteration, it yields a closed-form solution and refines the previous estimators gradually. After a finite number of iterations, the final solution estimates the rank consistently, and more importantly, achieves the oracle rate. We recast sufficient dimension reduction methods under the framework of reduced rank regressions, which enables us to recover the central subspace and simultaneously estimate its structural dimension. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed distributed algorithm through simulations and an application to the airline on-line performance dataset consisting of 118,914,458 observations.},

First, it is more general than combining a set of single point forecasts. Second, the asymptotic optimality is generally dependent on the estimation scheme and the asymptotic ratio of the length of forecast sequence relative to the in-sample size. Third, the asymptotically optimal weights may be consistently estimated under suitable conditions, while it needs the time series to be sufficiently long. We also assess the forecasting performance of our method using simulation data and real data.},

  abstract = {The growing size of modern data sets brings many challenges to the existing statistical estimation approaches, which calls for new distributed methodologies. This paper studies distributed estimation for a fundamental statistical machine learning problem, principal component analysis (PCA). Despite the massive literature on top eigenvector estimation, much less is presented for the top-L-dim (L {$>$} 1) eigenspace estimation, especially in a distributed manner. We propose a novel multi-round algorithm for constructing top-L-dim eigenspace for distributed data. Our algorithm takes advantage of shift-and-invert preconditioning and convex optimization. Our estimator is communication-efficient and achieves a fast convergence rate. In contrast to the existing divide-and-conquer algorithm, our approach has no restriction on the number of machines. Theoretically, we establish a gap-free error bound and abandon the assumption on the sharp eigengap between the L-th and the (L + 1)-th eigenvalues. Our distributed algorithm can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems ∗e-mail: xchen3@stern.nyu.edu.

  abstract = {This paper studies distributed estimation and support recovery for high-dimensional linear regression model with heavy-tailed noise. To deal with heavy-tailed noise whose variance can be infinite, we adopt the quantile regression loss function instead of the commonly used squared loss. However, the non-smooth quantile loss poses new challenges to high-dimensional distributed estimation in both computation and theoretical development. To address the challenge, we transform the response variable and establish a new connection between quantile regression and ordinary linear regression. Then, we provide a distributed estimator that is both computationally and communicationally efficient, where only the gradient information is communicated at each iteration. Theoretically, we show that, after a constant number of iterations, the proposed estimator achieves a near-oracle convergence rate without any restriction on the number of machines. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee for the support recovery. The simulation analysis is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Simple rules are designed to detect slowly-varying gradients and, therefore, trigger the reuse of outdated gradients. The resultant gradient-based algorithms are termed Lazily Aggregated Gradient — justifying our acronym LAG used henceforth. Theoretically, the merits of this contribution are: i) the convergence rate is the same as batch gradient descent in stronglyconvex, convex, and nonconvex cases; and, ii) if the distributed datasets are heterogeneous (quantified by certain measurable constants), the communication rounds needed to achieve a targeted accuracy are reduced thanks to the adaptive reuse of lagged gradients. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data corroborate a significant communication reduction compared to alternatives.},

The empirical application provides evidence of significant volatility and tail risk spillovers from the financial sector to many real sectors in the U.S. economy from 2001 to 2011. These spillovers increase in crisis periods. The CCX in a given sector is positively related to its amount of debt financing and negatively related to its valuation and investment. Therefore, real economy sectors—which require relatively high debt financing and whose value and investment activity are relatively lower—are prime candidates for stock price volatility and depreciation in the wake of a financial sector crisis. Evidence also suggests that the higher the industry’s degree of competition, the stronger the tail risk spillover from the financial sector.},

Prior information takes the form of benchmarks. These originate from the advice of experts, from forecasts of an annual econometric model or simply from pessimistic, realistic or optimistic scenarios contemplated by the analyst of the current economic situation. The benchmarks may represent annual levels to be achieved, neighbourhoods to be reached for a given time period, movements to be displayed or more generally any linear criteria to be satisfied by the forecasted values. The forecaster may then exercise his current economic evaluation and judgement to the fullest extent in deriving forecasts, since the laboriousness experienced without a systematic method is avoided.},

This class is inspired by free energy methods, which originate from Physics, and where one samples from a biased distribution such that a given function ξ(θ) of the state θ is forced to be uniformly distributed over a given interval. From an initial sequence of distributions (πt) of interest, and a particular choice of ξ(θ), a free energy SMC sampler computes sequentially a sequence of biased distributions (π˜t) with the following properties: (a) the marginal distribution of ξ(θ) with respect to π˜t is approximatively uniform over a specified interval, and (b) π˜t and πt have the same conditional distribution with respect to ξ. We apply our methodology to mixture posterior distributions, which are highly multimodal. In the mixture context, forcing certain hyper-parameters to higher values greatly faciliates mode swapping, and makes it possible to recover a symetric output. We illustrate our approach with univariate and bivariate Gaussian mixtures and two real-world datasets.},

It simultaneously captures skewness and heavy tailedness in data, while allowing the random effects and error distributions to have different degrees of freedom. It is fit using an EM-type algorithm. Simulations show that its efficiency for estimating mean response is comparable to that of the recent skew-t mixed model. But it may be considerably more efficient than the latter for estimating variance–covariance parameters when at least one of the random effects distribution or the error distribution has heavy tails, possibly due to outliers. The proposed model is used to analyze a data set consisting of lengths of claws of fiddler crabs (Uca mjoebergi).},

This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation methods are useful for generative models with intractable likelihoods. These methods are however sensitive to the dimension of the parameter space, requiring exponentially increasing resources as this dimension grows. To tackle this difficulty, we explore a Gibbs version of the Approximate Bayesian computation approach that runs component-wise approximate Bayesian computation steps aimed at the corresponding conditional posterior distributions, and based on summary statistics of reduced dimensions. While lacking the standard justifications for the Gibbs sampler, the resulting Markov chain is shown to converge in distribution under some partial independence conditions. The associated stationary distribution can further be shown to be close to the true posterior distribution and some hierarchical versions of the proposed mechanism enjoy a closed form limiting distribution. Experiments also demonstrate the gain in efficiency brought by the Gibbs version over the standard solution.},

  abstract = {A fundamental task in numerical computation is the solution of large linear systems. The conjugate gradient method is an iterative method which offers rapid convergence to the solution, particularly when an effective preconditioner is employed. However, for more challenging systems a substantial error can be present even after many iterations have been performed. The estimates obtained in this case are of little value unless further information can be provided about, for example, the magnitude of the error. In this paper we propose a novel statistical model for this error, set in a Bayesian framework. Our approach is a strict generalisation of the conjugate gradient method, which is recovered as the posterior mean for a particular choice of prior. The estimates obtained are analysed with Krylov subspace methods and a contraction result for the posterior is presented. The method is then analysed in a simulation study as well as being applied to a challenging problem in medical imaging.},

This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined, encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, with a challenging industrial application presented.},

Our experiments show that our forecasting tool is effective for cyclic data but somewhat less for irregular data such as stock prices.

For smooth convex and non-convex objective functions, we provide matching lower and upper complexity bounds and show that a naive pipeline parallelization of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent is optimal. For non-smooth convex functions, we provide a novel algorithm coined Pipeline Parallel Random Smoothing (PPRS) that is within a d1/4 multiplicative factor of the optimal convergence rate, where d is the underlying dimension. While the convergence rate still obeys a slow ε−2 convergence rate, the depth-dependent part is accelerated, resulting in a near-linear speed-up and convergence time that only slightly depends on the depth of the deep learning architecture. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of the non-smooth non-convex case and show that, for difficult and highly non-smooth problems, PPRS outperforms more traditional optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent for problems where the sample size is limited, such as few-shot or adversarial learning.},

  abstract = {Flexibly modeling the response variance in regression is important for efficient parameter estimation, correct inference, and for understanding the sources of variability in the response. Our article considers flexibly modelling the mean and variance functions within the framework of double exponential regression models, a class of overdispersed generalized linear models. The most general form of our model describes the mean and dispersion parameters in terms of additive functions of the predictors. Each of the additive terms can be either null, linear, or a fully flexible smooth effect. When the dispersion model is null the mean model is linear in the predictors and we obtain a generalized linear model, whereas with a null dispersion model and fully flexible smooth terms in the mean model we obtain a generalized additive model. Whether or not to include predictors, whether or not to model their effects linearly or flexibly, and whether or not to model overdispersion at all is determined from the data using a fully Bayesian approach to inference and model selection. Model selection is accomplished using a hierarchical prior which has many computational and inferential advantages over priors used in previous empirical Bayes approaches to similar problems. We describe an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme and priors that make the estimation of the model practical with a large number of predictors. The methodology is illustrated using real and simulated data.},

The two proposed multivariate VaR are vector-valued measures with the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. The lower-orthant VaR is constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions whereas the upperorthant VaR is constructed from level sets of multivariate survival functions. Several properties have been derived. In particular, we show that both these risk measures satisfy the positive homogeneity and the translation invariance property. Comparisons between univariate risk measures and components of multivariate VaR are provided. We also analyze how these measures are impacted by a change in marginal distributions, by a change in dependence structure and by a change in risk level. Illustrations are given in the class of Archimedean copulas.},

Using a large portfolio of residential subprime loans from an anonymous subprime lender, we show that default correlation is substantial for this lender. In particular, the significance of default correlation increases as the internal credit rating declines. Our results suggest that lenders and regulators would be well served investing in the understanding of default correlation in subprime portfolios.},

DINGO does not impose any specific form on the underlying functions and its application range extends far beyond convexity and smoothness. The underlying sub-problems of DINGO are simple linear least-squares, for which a plethora of efficient algorithms exist. DINGO involves a few hyper-parameters that are easy to tune and we theoretically show that a strict reduction in the surrogate objective is guaranteed, regardless of the selected hyper-parameters.},

  abstract = {As a prevalent distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) trains a global model on a massive amount of devices with infrequent communication. This paper investigates a class of composite optimization and statistical recovery problems in the FL setting, whose loss function consists of a data-dependent smooth loss and a non-smooth regularizer. Examples include sparse linear regression using Lasso, low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization, etc. In the existing literature, federated composite optimization algorithms are designed only from an optimization perspective without any statistical guarantees. In addition, they do not consider commonly used (restricted) strong convexity in statistical recovery problems. We advance the frontiers of this problem from both optimization and statistical perspectives. From optimization upfront, we propose a new algorithm named Fast Federated Dual Averaging for strongly convex and smooth loss and establish state-of-the-art iteration and communication complexity in the composite setting. In particular, we prove that it enjoys a fast rate, linear speedup, and reduced communication rounds. From statistical upfront, for restricted strongly convex and smooth loss, we design another algorithm, namely Multi-stage Federated Dual Averaging, and prove a high probability complexity bound with linear speedup up to optimal statistical precision. Numerical experiments in both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our methods perform better than other baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing fast optimization algorithms and statistical recovery guarantees for composite problems in FL.},

Two masked subsets of the M3 monthly industry data, containing 111 and 11 empirical time series respectively, were chosen, controlling for multiple data conditions of time series length (short/long), data patterns (seasonal/non-seasonal) and forecasting horizons (short/medium/long). The relative forecasting accuracy was assessed using the metrics from the M3, together with later extensions of scaled measures, and non-parametric statistical tests. The NN3 competition attracted 59 submissions from NN, CI and statistics, making it the largest CI competition on time series data. Its main findings include: (a) only one NN outperformed the damped trend using the sMAPE, but more contenders outperformed the AutomatANN of the M3; (b) ensembles of CI approaches performed very well, better than combinations of statistical methods; (c) a novel, complex statistical method outperformed all statistical and CI benchmarks; and (d) for the most difficult subset of short and seasonal series, a methodology employing echo state neural networks outperformed all others. The NN3 results highlight the ability of NN to handle complex data, including short and seasonal time series, beyond prior expectations, and thus identify multiple avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {We develop a probability forecasting model through a synthesis of Bayesian belief-network models and classical time-series analysis. By casting Bayesian time-series analyses as temporal belief-network problems, we introduce dependency models that capture richer and more realistic models of dynamic dependencies. With richer models and associated computational methods, we can move beyond the rigid classical assumptions of linearity in the relationships among variables and of normality of their probability distributions. We apply the methodology to the difficult problem of predicting outcome in critically ill patients. The nonlinear, dynamic behavior of the critical-care domain highlights the need for a synthesis of probability forecasting and uncertain reasoning.},

Sequential Monte Carlo with approximate Bayesian computations (SMC-ABC) is one approach to approximate the likelihood in this type of models. However, such approximations can be noisy and computationally costly which hinders efficient implementations using standard methods based on optimisation and Monte Carlo methods. We propose a computationally efficient novel method based on the combination of Gaussian process optimisation and SMC-ABC to create a Laplace approximation of the intractable posterior. We exemplify the proposed algorithm for inference in stochastic volatility models with both synthetic and real-world data as well as for estimating the Value-at-Risk for two portfolios using a copula model. We document speed-ups of between one and two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for posterior inference.},

The main mode of presentation is via code examples with liberal commenting of the code and the output, from the computational as well as the statistical viewpoint. Brief sections introduce the statistical methods before they are used. A supplementary R package can be downloaded and contains the data sets. All examples are directly runnable and all graphics in the text are generated from the examples. The statistical methodology covered includes statistical standard distributions, one- and two-sample tests with continuous data, regression analysis, one-and two-way analysis of variance, regression analysis, analysis of tabular data, and sample size calculations. In addition, the last four chapters contain introductions to multiple linear regression analysis, linear models in general, logistic regression, and survival analysis.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples efficiently from high-dimensional posterior distributions with proposed parameter draws obtained by iterating on a discretized version of the Hamiltonian dynamics. The iterations make HMC computationally costly, especially in problems with large datasets, since it is necessary to compute posterior densities and their derivatives with respect to the parameters. Naively computing the Hamiltonian dynamics on a subset of the data causes HMC to lose its key ability to generate distant parameter proposals with high acceptance probability. The key insight in our article is that efficient subsampling HMC for the parameters is possible if both the dynamics and the acceptance probability are computed from the same data subsample in each complete HMC iteration. We show that this is possible to do in a principled way in a HMC-within-Gibbs framework where the subsample is updated using a pseudo marginal MH step and the parameters are then updated using an HMC step, based on the current subsample. We show that our subsampling methods are fast and compare favorably to two popular sampling algorithms that utilize gradient estimates from data subsampling. We also explore the current limitations of subsampling HMC algorithms by varying the quality of the variance reducing control variates used in the estimators of the posterior density and its gradients.},

Former approaches have tried to condition the generative process on the textual data; but allying it to the usage of class information, known to diversify the generated samples and improve their structural coherence, has not been explored. We trained the presented TAC-GAN model on the Oxford102 dataset of flowers, and evaluated the discriminability of the generated images with Inception-Score, as well as their diversity using the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM). Our approach outperforms the stateof-the-art models, i.e., its inception score is 3.45, corresponding to a relative increase of 7.8\% compared to the recently introduced StackGan. A comparison of the mean MS-SSIM scores of the training and generated samples per class shows that our approach is able to generate highly diverse images with an average MS-SSIM of 0.14 over all generated classes.},

  abstract = {In a multi-class classification problem, it is standard to model the output of a neural network as a categorical distribution conditioned on the inputs. The output must therefore be positive and sum to one, which is traditionally enforced by a softmax. This probabilistic mapping allows to use the maximum likelihood principle, which leads to the well-known log-softmax loss. However the choice of the softmax function seems somehow arbitrary as there are many other possible normalizing functions. It is thus unclear why the log-softmax loss would perform better than other loss alternatives. In particular Vincent et al. (2015) recently introduced a class of loss functions, called the spherical family, for which there exists an efficient algorithm to compute the updates of the output weights irrespective of the output size. In this paper, we explore several loss functions from this family as possible alternatives to the traditional log-softmax. In particular, we focus our investigation on spherical bounds of the log-softmax loss and on two spherical log-likelihood losses, namely the log-Spherical Softmax suggested by Vincent et al. (2015) and the log-Taylor Softmax that we introduce. Although these alternatives do not yield as good results as the log-softmax loss on two language modeling tasks, they surprisingly outperform it in our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10, suggesting that they might be relevant in a broad range of applications.},

  abstract = {We provide a geometric interpretation to Bayesian inference that allows us to introduce a natural measure of the level of agreement between priors, likelihoods, and posteriors. The starting point for the construction of our geometry is the observation that the marginal likelihood can be regarded as an inner product between the prior and the likelihood. A key concept in our geometry is that of compatibility, a measure which is based on the same construction principles as Pearson correlation, but which can be used to assess how much the prior agrees with the likelihood, to gauge the sensitivity of the posterior to the prior, and to quantify the coherency of the opinions of two experts. Estimators for all the quantities involved in our geometric setup are discussed, which can be directly computed from the posterior simulation output. Some examples are used to illustrate our methods, including data related to on-the-job drug usage, midge wing length, and prostate cancer.},

We show that similar results also hold for expectations of arbitrary statistics in dependent random variables.

Agents are linked by productive and credit relationships so that the behavior of one agent influences the behavior of the others through network connections. Credit interlinkages among agents are a source of bankruptcy diffusion: in fact, failure of fulfilling debt commitments would lead to bankruptcy chains. All in all, the bankruptcy in one sector can diffuse to other sectors through linkages creating a vicious cycle and bankruptcy avalanches in the network economy. Our analysis show how the choices of credit supply by both banks and firms are interrelated. While the initial impact of monetary policy is on bank behaviour, we show the interactive play between the choices made by banks, the choices made by firms in their role as providers of credit, and the choices made by firms in their role as producers.},

  abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a largescale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 5001000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

Because the Chinese language differs most significantly from alphabet-based languages in not specifying word boundaries, most existing Chinese text-mining methods require a prespecified vocabulary and/or a large relevant training corpus, which may not be available in some applications. We introduce an unsupervised method, top-down word discovery and segmentation (TopWORDS), for simultaneously discovering and segmenting words and phrases from large volumes of unstructured Chinese texts, and propose ways to order discovered words and conduct higher-level context analyses. TopWORDS is particularly useful for mining online and domain-specific texts where the underlying vocabulary is unknown or the texts of interest differ significantly from available training corpora. When outputs from TopWORDS are fed into context analysis tools such as topic modeling, word embedding, and association pattern finding, the results are as good as or better than that from using outputs of a supervised segmentation method.},

  abstract = {Sequential auction models of labor market competition predict that the wages required to successfully poach a worker from a rival employer will depend on the productivities of both the poached and poaching firms. We develop a theoretically grounded extension of the two-way fixed effects model of Abowd et al. (1999) in which log hiring wages are comprised of a worker fixed effect, a fixed effect for the ‘‘destination’’ firm hiring the worker, and a fixed effect for the ‘‘origin’’ firm, or labor market state, from which the worker was hired. This specification is shown to nest the reduced form for hiring wages delivered by semi-parametric formulations of the canonical sequential auction model of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b) and its generalization in Bagger et al. (2014). Fitting the model to Italian social security records, origin effects are found to explain only 0.7\% of the variance of hiring wages among job movers, while destination effects explain more than 23\% of the variance. Across firms, destination effects are more than 13 times as variable as origin effects. Interpreted through the lens of Bagger et al. (2014)’s model, this finding requires that workers possess implausibly strong bargaining strength. Studying a cohort of workers entering the Italian labor market in 2005, we find that differences in origin effects yield essentially no contribution to the evolution of the gender gap in hiring wages, while differences in destination effects explain the majority of the gap at the time of labor market entry. These results suggest that where a worker is hired from tends to be relatively inconsequential for their wages in comparison to where they are currently employed.},

Cross-sectional and temporal hierarchies have been considered in the literature, but generally, these two features have not been fully considered together. The paper presents two new results by adopting a notation that simultaneously deals with both forecast reconciliation dimensions. (i) The closed-form expression of the optimal (in the least squares sense) point forecasts fulfilling both contemporaneous and temporal constraints. (ii) An iterative procedure that produces cross-temporally reconciled forecasts by alternating forecast reconciliation along one single dimension (either cross-sectional or temporal) at each iteration step. The feasibility of the proposed procedures, along with first evaluations of their performance as compared to the most performing ‘single dimension’ (either crosssectional or temporal) forecast reconciliation procedures, is studied through a forecasting experiment on the 95 quarterly time series of the Australian Gross Domestic Product from Income and Expenditure sides. For this dataset, the new procedures, in addition to providing fully coherent forecasts in both cross-sectional and temporal dimensions, improve the forecast accuracy of the state-of-the-art point forecast reconciliation techniques.},

In particular, we provide insights into the nature and mathematical derivation of the level-l conditional coherent (LlCC) point forecast reconciliation procedure for an elementary two-level hierarchy. We show that: (i) the LlCC procedure is the result of a linearly constrained minimization of a quadratic loss function, with an exogenous constraint given by the base forecast of the top level series of the hierarchy, which is not revised; and (ii) endogenous constraints may also be considered in the same framework, thereby resulting in level conditional reconciled forecasts where both the top and the bottom level time series forecasts are coherently revised. In addition, we show that the LlCC procedure (i.e., with exogenous constraints but the result also holds in the endogenous case) does not guarantee the non-negativity of the reconciled forecasts, which can be an issue in cases when non-negativity is a natural attribute of the variables that need to be forecast (e.g., sales and tourism flows). Finally, we consider two forecasting experiments to evaluate the performance of various cross-sectional forecast combination-based point forecast reconciliation procedures (vis-à-vis the state-of-the-art procedures) in a fair setting. In this framework, due to the crucial role played by the (possibly different) models used to compute the base forecasts, we re-interpret the combined conditional coherent reconciliation procedure (CCCH) of Hollyman et~al. (2021) as a forecast pooling approach, and show that accuracy improvements may be obtained by adopting a simple forecast averaging strategy.},

For nonnormal models, we approximate the integrated likelihood ratios needed to compute acceptance probabilities by using the Bayesian information criterion, BIC, under priors that make this approximation accurate. Our technique is based on a marginalised chain on the knot number and locations, but we provide methods for inference about the regression coefficients, and functions of them, in both normal and nonnormal models. Simulation results suggest that the method performs well, and we illustrate the method in two neuroscience applications.},

However, some applications require an extension to more general spaces. For example, phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees are defined in terms of both a discrete graph and associated continuous parameters; although one can represent these aspects using a single connected space, this rather complex space is not suitable for existing HMC algorithms. In this paper, we develop Probabilistic Path HMC (PPHMC) as a first step to sampling distributions on spaces with intricate combinatorial structure. We define PPHMC on orthant complexes, show that the resulting Markov chain is ergodic, and provide a promising implementation for the case of phylogenetic trees in opensource software. We also show that a surrogate function to ease the transition across a boundary on which the log-posterior has discontinuous derivatives can greatly improve efficiency.},

Since multivariate copulae constructed through pair-copula decompositions were introduced to the statistical community, interest in these models has been growing steadily and they are finding successful applications in various fields. Research so far has however been concentrating on so-called canonical and D-vine copulae, which are more restrictive cases of regular vine copulae. It is shown how to evaluate the density of arbitrary regular vine specifications. This opens the vine copula methodology to the flexible modeling of complex dependencies even in larger dimensions. In this regard, a new automated model selection and estimation technique based on graph theoretical considerations is presented. This comprehensive search strategy is evaluated in a large simulation study and applied to a 16-dimensional financial data set of international equity, fixed income and commodity indices which were observed over the last decade, in particular during the recent financial crisis. The analysis provides economically well interpretable results and interesting insights into the dependence structure among these indices.},

  abstract = {Latent variable models are a popular class of models in statistics. Combined with neural networks to improve their expressivity, the resulting deep latent variable models have also found numerous applications in machine learning. A drawback of these models is that their likelihood function is intractable so approximations have to be carried out to perform inference. A standard approach consists of maximizing instead an evidence lower bound (ELBO) obtained based on a variational approximation of the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The standard ELBO can, however, be a very loose bound if the variational family is not rich enough. A generic strategy to tighten such bounds is to rely on an unbiased low-variance Monte Carlo estimate of the evidence. We review here some recent importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo strategies that have been proposed to achieve this.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

However, the practical utility of such estimates is limited by how accurately they quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the joint predictive distribution of high-dimensional multivariate time series. We propose a versatile method, based on the transformer architecture, that estimates joint distributions using an attentionbased decoder that provably learns to mimic the properties of non-parametric copulas. The resulting model has several desirable properties: it can scale to hundreds of time series, supports both forecasting and interpolation, can handle unaligned and non-uniformly sampled data, and can seamlessly adapt to missing data during training. We demonstrate these properties empirically and show that our model produces state-of-the-art predictions on several real-world datasets.},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

To study such scenarios, we define and study some refinements of the classical minimax risk that apply to distributed settings, comparing to the performance of estimators with access to the entire data. Lower bounds on these quantities provide a precise characterization of the minimum amount of communication required to achieve the centralized minimax risk. We study two classes of distributed protocols: one in which machines send messages independently over channels without feedback, and a second allowing for interactive communication, in which a central server broadcasts the messages from a given machine to all other machines. We establish lower bounds for a variety of problems, including location estimation in several families and parameter estimation in different types of regression models. Our results include a novel class of quantitative data-processing inequalities used to characterize the effects of limited communication.},

This paper identifies international contagion in banking during the 2007–2009 crisis for 54 economies. We identify three channels of contagion – systematic, idiosyncratic and volatility – and find evidence for these in 45 countries. Banking crises are overwhelmingly associated with the presence of both systematic and idiosyncratic contagion. The results reveal that crisis shocks transmitted from a foreign jurisdiction via idiosyncratic contagion increase the likelihood of a systemic crisis in the domestic banking system by almost 37 percent, whereas increased exposure via systematic contagion does not necessarily destabilize the domestic banking system. Thus while policy makers and regulatory authorities are rightly concerned with the systematic transmission of banking crises, reducing the potential for idiosyncratic contagion can importantly reduce the consequences for the domestic economy.},

  abstract = {In a 1970 Biometrika paper, W. K. Hastings developed a broad class of Markov chain algorithms for sampling from probability distributions that are difficult to sample from directly. The algorithm draws a candidate value from a proposal distribution and accepts the candidate with a probability that can be computed using only the unnormalized density of the target distribution, allowing one to sample from distributions known only up to a constant of proportionality. The stationary distribution of the corresponding Markov chain is the target distribution one is attempting to sample from. The Hastings algorithm generalizes the Metropolis algorithm to allow a much broader class of proposal distributions instead of just symmetric cases. An important class of applications for the Hastings algorithm corresponds to sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions, which have densities given by a prior density multiplied by a likelihood function and divided by a normalizing constant equal to the marginal likelihood. The marginal likelihood is typically intractable, presenting a fundamental barrier to implementation in Bayesian statistics. This barrier can be overcome by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. Amazingly, even after 50 years, the majority of algorithms used in practice today involve the Hastings algorithm. This article provides a brief celebration of the continuing impact of this ingenious algorithm on the 50th anniversary of its publication.},

Our main result is the weak convergence of the Markov chain (appropriately rescaled in time and space) to a Langevin diffusion process as the dimension               d               goes to ∞. As the log-density might be nondifferentiable, the limiting diffusion could be singular. The scaling limit is established under assumptions which are much weaker than the one used in the original derivation of Roberts               et al.               (1997). This result has important practical implications for the use of random walk Metropolis algorithms in Bayesian frameworks based on sparsity inducing priors.},

We evaluate forecast performance using out-of-sample predictions from 1996 to 2004. We find that the Edo model can provide forecasts that are competitive with those of Federal Reserve staff. Taken together with the fact that the Edo model has also proved useful in answering a range of policy questions, this suggests a significant and broad role for richly specified DSGE models in the toolbox of central bank models.

The nature of propagation of such contagion is determined by the underlying connections between firms, which can adversely affect the tail risks of firm value, hence the securities issued by the firm. This paper combines the insights gained from the existing firm-value models and historical events into a structural model for flow of contagion among firms using a network-based approach. Rather than using stylized networks, we develop a data-driven approach for network construction where we define and calibrate several contagion variables to model the spread of contagion. This framework is applied for assessing firm-level risk under downside risk measures. Using actual data, our model illustrates how connections between firms can lead to heavy-tailed default distributions and default clustering observed in practice.},

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple formula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponential family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

The model is analyzed from a Bayesian perspective and has the benefit of automatically down-weighting time points close to motion spikes in a data-driven manner. We develop a highly efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix) and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli, head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI data analysis. Our results show that the GLMH tends to detect more brain activity, compared to its homoscedastic counterpart, by allowing the variance to change over time depending on the degree of head motion.},

Data was extracted on the statistical methods described, their advantages, disadvantages, relative performance and recommendations of the study. Sixty-eight studies were included. Of them, 27 (40\%) assessed methods for baseline imbalances, 39 (57\%) assessed methods for skewed costs and/or effects, 27 (40\%) assessed methods for correlated costs and effects, 18 (26\%) assessed methods for clustered data, 7 (10\%) assessed methods for longitudinal data, 26 (38\%) assessed methods for missing data and 10 (15\%) assessed methods for censoring. All identified methods were narratively described. This review provides a comprehensive overview of available statistical methods for dealing with the most common statistical complexities in trial-based economic evaluations.

  abstract = {Understanding model performance on unlabeled data is a fundamental challenge of developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems. Model performance is typically evaluated using test sets or periodic manual quality assessments, both of which require laborious manual data labeling. Automated performance prediction techniques aim to mitigate this burden, but potential inaccuracy and a lack of trust in their predictions has prevented their widespread adoption. We address this core problem of performance prediction uncertainty with a method to compute prediction intervals for model performance. Our methodology uses transfer learning to train an uncertainty model to estimate the uncertainty of model performance predictions. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of drift conditions and show substantial improvement over competitive baselines. We believe this result makes prediction intervals, and performance prediction in general, significantly more practical for real-world use.},

Using a reduced form model and sequential Kalman filtering estimation we decompose the credit risk of a sample of corporate bonds (14 US firms, 2001-2003) into different unobservable risk factors. A single common factor accounts for more than 50\% of all (but two) of the firms’ credit risk levels, with an average of 68\% across firms. This factor represents the credit risk levels underlying the US economy and is strongly correlated with main US stock indexes.},

Integration (greater dependence on counterparties) and diversification (more counterparties per organization) have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Diversification connects the network initially, permitting cascades to travel; but as it increases further, organizations are better insured against one another's failures. Integration also faces trade-offs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate the model with data on European debt cross-holdings.

The "relative nonlinearity" is defined as the dimensional nonlinearity divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum assayed values. These definitions may be used to develop practical criteria for linearity that are still objective. Calculation of the nonlinearity requires a method of curve-fitting. In this article, we use polynomial regression to demonstrate calculations, but the definition of nonlinearity also accommodates alternative nonlinear regression procedures.},

This paper deals with the static (non-time-dependent) case and emphasizes the copula representation of dependence for a random vector. Linear correlation is a natural dependence measure for multivariate normally and, more generally, elliptically distributed risks but other dependence concepts like comonotonicity and rank correlation should also be understood by the risk management practitioner. Using counterexamples the falsity of some commonly held views on correlation is demonstrated; in general, these fallacies arise from the naive assumption that dependence properties of the elliptical world also hold in the non-elliptical world. In particular, the problem of finding multivariate models which are consistent with prespecified marginal distributions and correlations is addressed. Pitfalls are highlighted and simulation algorithms avoiding these problems are constructed.},

  abstract = {Class imbalance is a common problem in supervised learning and impedes the predictive performance of classification models. Popular countermeasures include oversampling the minority class. Standard methods like SMOTE rely on finding nearest neighbours and linear interpolations which are problematic in case of high-dimensional, complex data distributions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed as an alternative method for generating artificial minority examples as they can model complex distributions. However, prior research on GAN-based oversampling does not incorporate recent advancements from the literature on generating realistic tabular data with GANs. Previous studies also focus on numerical variables whereas categorical features are common in many business applications of classification methods such as credit scoring. The paper propoes an oversampling method based on a conditional Wasserstein GAN that can effectively model tabular datasets with numerical and categorical variables and pays special attention to the down-stream classification task through an auxiliary classifier loss. We benchmark our method against standard oversampling methods and the imbalanced baseline on seven real-world datasets. Empirical results evidence the competitiveness of GAN-based oversampling.},

We show that the problem of multivariate conditional variance estimation can be simplified by estimating univariate GARCH models for each asset, and then, using transformed residuals resulting from the first stage, estimating a conditional correlation estimator. The standard errors for the first stage parameters remain consistent, and only the standard errors for the correlation parameters need be modified. We use the model to estimate the conditional covariance of up to 100 assets using S\&P 500 Sector Indices and Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and conduct specification tests of the estimator using an industry standard benchmark for volatility models. This new estimator demonstrates very strong performance especially considering ease of implementation of the estimator.},

  abstract = {Background: Time series microarray experiments are widely used to study dynamical biological processes. Due to the cost of microarray experiments, and also in some cases the limited availability of biological material, about 80\% of microarray time series experiments are short (3–8 time points). Previously short time series gene expression data has been mainly analyzed using more general gene expression analysis tools not designed for the unique challenges and opportunities inherent in short time series gene expression data. Results: We introduce the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) the first software program specifically designed for the analysis of short time series microarray gene expression data. STEM implements unique methods to cluster, compare, and visualize such data. STEM also supports efficient and statistically rigorous biological interpretations of short time series data through its integration with the Gene Ontology. Conclusion: The unique algorithms STEM implements to cluster and compare short time series gene expression data combined with its visualization capabilities and integration with the Gene Ontology should make STEM useful in the analysis of data from a significant portion of all microarray studies.

Because these patterns in average returns apparently are not explained by the CAPM, they are called anomalies. We find that, except for the continuation of short-term returns, the anomalies largely disappear in a three-factor model. Our results are consistent with rational ICAPM or APT asset pricing, but we also consider irrational pricing and data problems as possible explanations.},

  abstract = {We consider forecasting a single time series when there is a large number of predictors and a possible nonlinear effect. The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.},

  abstract = {Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality since generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that may have never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We claim that validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated by a model. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic conditional and unconditional text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.},

Unlike standard principal component approaches typically used to reduce complexity, our approach is tailored to the degenerated design of IVS data. In particular, we only fit in the local neighborhood of the design points by exploiting the expiry effect present in option data. Using DAX index option data, we estimate the nonparametric components and a low-dimensional time series of latent factors. The modeling approach is completed by studying vector autoregressive models fitted to the latent factors.},

Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.},

  abstract = {The traditional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is often of limited use in complex high-dimensional data due to the intractability of the underlying likelihood function. Maximum composite likelihood estimation (McLE) avoids full likelihood specification by combining a number of partial likelihood objects depending on small data subsets, thus enabling inference for complex data. A fundamental difficulty in making the McLE approach practicable is the selection from numerous candidate likelihood objects for constructing the composite likelihood function. In this paper, we propose a flexible Gibbs sampling scheme for optimal selection of sub-likelihood components. The sampled composite likelihood functions are shown to converge to the one maximally informative on the unknown parameters in equilibrium, since sub-likelihood objects are chosen with probability depending on the variance of the corresponding McLE. A penalized version of our method generates sparse likelihoods with a relatively small number of components when the data complexity is intense. Our algorithms are illustrated through numerical examples on simulated data as well as real genotype SNP data from a case-control study.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the research literature on forecasting retail demand. We begin by introducing the forecasting problems that retailers face, from the strategic to the operational, as sales are aggregated over products to stores and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice.},

  abstract = {In suitably initialized wide networks, small learning rates transform deep neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training. During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance matches that of full network training in 15\% to 45\% of training time. Overall, our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the development of more accurate theories of deep learning.},

We discuss that, in the basic setting of random sampling—that is, in the Bayesian approach, exchangeability—uncertainty expressed by the posterior distribution and credible intervals can indeed be understood in terms of prediction. The posterior law on the unknown distribution is centred on the predictive distribution and we prove that it is marginally asymptotically Gaussian with variance depending on the predictive updates, i.e. on how the predictive rule incorporates information as new observations become available. This allows to obtain asymptotic credible intervals only based on the predictive rule (without having to specify the model and the prior law), sheds light on frequentist coverage as related to the predictive learning rule, and, we believe, opens a new perspective towards a notion of predictive efficiency that seems to call for further research.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Several applications involving counts present a large proportion of zeros (excess-of-zeros data). A popular model for such data is the hurdle model, which explicitly models the probability of a zero count, while assuming a sampling distribution on the positive integers. We consider data from multiple count processes. In this context, it is of interest to study the patterns of counts and cluster the subjects accordingly. We introduce a novel Bayesian approach to cluster multiple, possibly related, zero-inflated processes. We propose a joint model for zero-inflated counts, specifying a hurdle model for each process with a shifted Negative Binomial sampling distribution. Conditionally on the model parameters, the different processes are assumed independent, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of parameters as compared with traditional multivariate approaches. The subject-specific probabilities of zero-inflation and the parameters of the sampling distribution are flexibly modelled via an enriched finite mixture with random number of components. This induces a two-level clustering of the subjects based on the zero/non-zero patterns (outer clustering) and on the sampling distribution (inner clustering). Posterior inference is performed through tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes. We demonstrate the proposed approach on an application involving the use of the messaging service WhatsApp.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

In particular, we focus on whether liquidity effects are more pronounced in periods of financial crises, especially for bonds with high credit risk, using a unique data set covering more than 20,000 bonds, between October 2004 and December 2008. We employ a wide range of liquidity measures and find that liquidity effects account for approximately 14\% of the explained market-wide corporate yield spread changes. We conclude that the economic impact of the liquidity measures is significantly larger in periods of crisis, and for speculative grade bonds.},

JAX uses the XLA compiler infrastructure to generate optimized code for the program subroutines that are most favorable for acceleration, and these optimized subroutines can be called and orchestrated by arbitrary Python. Because the system is fully compatible with Autograd, it allows forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python functions to arbitrary order. Because JAX supports structured control flow, it can generate code for sophisticated machine learning algorithms while maintaining high performance. We show that by combining JAX with Autograd and Numpy we get an easily programmable and highly performant ML system that targets CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, capable of scaling to multi-core Cloud TPUs.},

(Legramanti et al. 2020 Biometrika107, 745–752. (doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa008)), which is a spike-and-slab shrinkage prior where the spike probability is stochastically increasing and constructed from the stick-breaking representation of a Dirichlet process prior. As a first contribution, this CUSP prior is extended by involving arbitrary stick-breaking representations arising from beta distributions. As a second contribution, we prove that exchangeable spike-and-slab priors, which are popular and widely used in sparse Bayesian factor analysis, can be represented as a finite generalized CUSP prior, which is easily obtained from the decreasing order statistics of the slab probabilities. Hence, exchangeable spike-and-slab shrinkage priors imply increasing shrinkage as the column index in the loading matrix increases, without imposing explicit order constraints on the slab probabilities. An application to sparse Bayesian factor analysis illustrates the usefulness of the findings of this paper. A new exchangeable spike-and-slab shrinkage prior based on the triple gamma prior of Cadonna et al. (Cadonna et al. 2020 Econometrics8, 20. (doi:10.3390/econometrics8020020)) is introduced and shown to be helpful for estimating the unknown number of factors in a simulation study.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Traditional visualization of time series data often consists of plotting the time series values against time and ‘connecting the dots’. We propose an alternative, multiscale visualization technique, motivated by the scale–space approach in computer vision. In brief, our method also ‘connects the dots’ but uses a range of pens of varying thicknesses for this. The resulting multiscale map, which is termed the thick pen transform, corresponds to viewing the time series from a range of distances. We formally prove that the thick pen transform is a discriminatory statistic for two Gaussian time series with distinct correlation structures. Further, we show interesting possible applications of the thick pen transform to measuring cross-dependence in multivariate time series, classifying time series and testing for stationarity. In particular, we derive the asymptotic distribution of our test statistic and argue that the test is applicable to both linear and non-linear processes under low moment assumptions. Various other aspects of the methodology, including other possible applications, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In Gardner [Gardner, E. S., Jr. (1985). Exponential smoothing: The state of the art. Journal of Forecasting 4, 1–28], I reviewed the research in exponential smoothing since the original work by Brown and Holt. This paper brings the state of the art up to date. The most important theoretical advance is the invention of a complete statistical rationale for exponential smoothing based on a new class of state-space models with a single source of error. The most important practical advance is the development of a robust method for smoothing damped multiplicative trends. We also have a new adaptive method for simple smoothing, the first such method to demonstrate credible improved forecast accuracy over fixed-parameter smoothing. Longstanding confusion in the literature about whether and how to renormalize seasonal indices in the Holt–Winters methods has finally been resolved. There has been significant work in forecasting for inventory control, including the development of new predictive distributions for total lead-time demand and several improved versions of Croston's method for forecasting intermittent time series. Regrettably, there has been little progress in the identification and selection of exponential smoothing methods. The research in this area is best described as inconclusive, and it is still difficult to beat the application of a damped trend to every time series.},

Investors and firms are located on a circle, and access to markets involves participation costs that increase with distance. Due to a complementarity between participation and leverage decisions, the market equilibrium may exhibit diverse leverage and participation choices across investors, even though investors are ex-ante identical. Small changes in market-access costs can cause a change in the type of equilibrium and lead to discontinuous price changes, de-leveraging, and portfolioflow reversals. Moreover, the market is subject to contagion, in that an adverse shock to investors in a subset of locations affects prices everywhere.},

However, due to the short nature of sales times series in E-commerce, univariate methods don’t apply well. In this article, we propose a global model which outperforms stateof-the-art models on real dataset. It is achieved by using Tree Boosting Methods that exploit non-linearity and cross-series information. We also proposed a preprocessing framework to overcome the inherent difficulties in the E-commerce data. In particular, we use different schemes to limit the impact of the volatility of the data.},

We demonstrate insights on the power of ensemble learning for forecasting, showing experiment results on about 16000 openly available datasets, from M4, M5, M3 competitions, as well as FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) datasets. Whereas experiments show that ensembles provide a benefit on forecasting results, there is no clear winning ensemble strategy (plus hyperparameter configuration). Thus, in addition, (2), we propose a meta-learning step to choose, for each dataset, the most appropriate ensemble method and their hyperparameter configuration to run based on dataset meta-features.},

Using data on North American supplier–customer network of public companies, we find that, for each supplier, counterparties’ leverage and option implied volatilities are significant determinants of corporate credit spreads in the period after the 2008–2009 U.S. recession. Our findings are robust after controlling for several idiosyncratic, industry, and market factors.},

Asymptotically equivalent but numerically much simpler estimators of the same coefficients are given here.

It is further shown that the M¨obius decomposition of the multilinear extension (or checkerboard) copula leads to tie-corrected versions of dependence coefficients originally introduced by Genest and R´emillard (2004). These coefficients can be used to visualize dependence structures and to construct tests of mutual independence that can be more powerful than those based on tie-corrected versions of Spearman’s rho.},

The fact that each produces a sample whose constituents are neither independent nor identically distributed complicates the assessment of convergence and numerical accuracy of the approximations to the expected value of functions of interest under the posterior. In this paper methods from spectral analysis are used to evaluate numerical accuracy formally and construct diagnostics for convergence. These methods are illustrated in the normal linear model with informative priors, and in the Tobit-censored regression model.},

We provide an explicit normal approximation of the distribution of portfolio losses. We quantify the relation between the variability of global economic fundamentals, strength of local firm interaction, and the fluctuation of losses. We find that cyclical oscillations in fundamentals dominate average losses, while local interaction causes additional fluctuations of losses around their average. The strength of the contagion-induced loss variability depends on the complexity of the business partner network.},

In particular, we provide an explicit Gaussian approximation of the distribution of portfolio losses.

  abstract = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodelbased exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (q-EI), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the q-EI is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the q-EI, and apply them to Gaussian Processes and to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q ∈ [1, 10]).},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a simple model of endogenous supply-chains formation to address the theoretical nexus between trade-credit, bank credit and credit contagion. We make two contributions. First, we show that competitive markets in which heterogeneous price-taker firms compete strategically by setting trade-credit maturities have a unique symmetric equilibrium in trade-terms and the equilibrium dictates the production flow along the supply chains. Secondly, we find that the network can have a role either as shock absorber or shock amplifier and this is determined by a testable condition which holds for a general class of trade-credit networks. On these grounds, we argue that the proportional credit rationing used by banks (i.e., richer borrowers obtain larger loans) may have ambiguous effects on systemic vulnerability. In fact, if for intermediate levels of bank-credit only a subset of firms substitute trade-credit in favor of bank-credit, the bank may worsen the quality of the inter-firm credit network, thus increasing the systemic vulnerability above the contagion threshold.},

This change allows us to consider more severe distress events, to backtest CoVaR, and to improve its consistency (monotonicity) with respect to the dependence parameter. We define the systemic risk contribution of an institution as the change from its CoVaR in its benchmark state (defined as a one-standard deviation event) to its CoVaR under financial distress. We estimate the systemic risk contributions of four financial industry groups consisting of a large number of institutions for the sample period June 2000 to February 2008 and the 12 months prior to the beginning of the crisis. We also investigate the link between institutions’ contributions to systemic risk and their characteristics.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

  abstract = {We are concerned with the interaction and integration between demand forecasting and inventory control, in the context of supply chain operations. The majority of the literature is fragmented. Forecasting research more often than not assumes forecasting to be an end in itself, disregarding any subsequent stages of computation that are needed to transform forecasts into replenishment decisions. Conversely, most contributions in inventory theory assume that demand (and its parameters) are known, in effect disregarding any preceding stages of computation. Explicit recognition of these shortcomings is an important step towards more realistic theoretical developments, but still not particularly helpful unless they are somehow addressed. Even then, forecasts often constitute exogenous variables that serially feed into a stock control model. Finally, there is a small but growing stream of research that is explicitly built around jointly tackling the inventory forecasting question. We introduce a framework to define four levels of integration: from disregarding, to acknowledging, to partly addressing, to fully understanding the interactions. Focusing on the last two, we conduct a structured review of relevant (integrated) academic contributions in the area of forecasting and inventory control and argue for their classification with regard to integration. We show that the development from one level to another is in many cases chronological in order, but also associated with specific schools of thought. We also argue that although movement from one level to another adds realism, it also adds complexity in terms of actual implementations, and thus a trade-off exists. The article makes a contribution into an area that has always been fragmented despite the importance of bringing the forecasting and inventory communities together to solve problems of common interest. We close with an indicative agenda for further research and a call for more theoretical contributions, but also more work that would help to expand the empirical knowledge base in this area.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

A less studied problem is that of optimization under unknown constraints, i.e., when the simulator must be invoked both to determine the typical real-valued response and to determine if a constraint has been violated, either for physical or policy reasons. We develop a statistical approach based on Gaussian processes and Bayesian learning to both approximate the unknown function and estimate the probability of meeting the constraints. A new integrated improvement criterion is proposed to recognize that responses from inputs that violate the constraint may still be informative about the function, and thus could potentially be useful in the optimization. The new criterion is illustrated on synthetic data, and on a motivating optimization problem from health care policy.},

In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects. Approximate models and algorithms may thus be at the core of the next computational revolution.},

Models are fitted using bias-corrected least squares in order to attenuate the effects of small sample bias of forecast loss. We begin by constructing a general estimator of the quadratic forecast risk of the averaged model that is asymptotically unbiased as both n (cross sections) and T (time series) grow large. Armed with this result, we propose a specific weighting mechanism, in which weights are chosen to minimize the estimated quadratic risk of the averaged forecast error. The objective function in this minimization problem is a version of the Mallows Cp criterion modified for application to the panel data setting. The forecast combination method performs well in Monte Carlo simulations and pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting applications.},

A product of a proposal density and K copies of the target density is used to define a joint density which is sampled by a Gibbs sampler including a Metropolis step. This provides a framework for adaptation since the current value of all K copies of the target distribution can be used in the proposal distribution. The methodology is justified by standard Gibbs sampling theory and generalizes several previously proposed algorithms. It is particularly suited to Metropolis-within-Gibbs updating and we discuss the application of our methods in this context. The method is illustrated with both a Metropolis–Hastings independence sampler and a Metropolis-with-Gibbs independence sampler. Comparisons are made with standard adaptive Metropolis–Hastings methods.},

We derive the distribution by taking the limit of a distribution over N × K binary matrices as K → ∞, a strategy inspired by the derivation of the Chinese restaurant process (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002) as the limit of a Dirichlet-multinomial model. This strategy preserves the exchangeability of the rows of matrices. We define several simple generative processes that result in the same distribution over equivalence classes of binary matrices, one of which we call the Indian buffet process. We illustrate the use of this distribution as a prior in an infinite latent feature model, deriving a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model and applying this algorithm to an artificial dataset.},

The resulting quasi-conditional paradigm is illustrated by re-interpreting a previous influential partial Bayes-frequentist unification, Kiefer–Berger–Brown–Wolpert conditional frequentist tests, in terms of e-posteriors.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Varying coefficient models (VCMs) are widely used for estimating nonlinear regression functions for functional data. Their Bayesian variants using Gaussian process priors on the functional coefficients, however, have received limited attention in massive data applications, mainly due to the prohibitively slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We address this problem using a divide-and-conquer Bayesian approach. We first create a large number of data subsamples with much smaller sizes. Then, we formulate the VCM as a linear mixed-effects model and develop a data augmentation algorithm for obtaining MCMC draws on all the subsets in parallel. Finally, we aggregate the MCMC-based estimates of subset posteriors into a single Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC) posterior, which is used as a computationally efficient alternative to the true posterior distribution. Theoretically, we derive minimax optimal posterior convergence rates for the AMC posteriors of both the varying coefficients and the mean regression function. We provide quantification on the orders of subset sample sizes and the number of subsets. The empirical results show that the combination schemes that satisfy our theoretical assumptions, including the AMC posterior, have better estimation performance than their main competitors across diverse simulations and in a real data analysis.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many accurate decision support systems have been constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

  abstract = {Bayesian models often involve a small set of hyperparameters determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood. Bayesian optimization is a popular iterative method where a Gaussian process posterior of the underlying function is sequentially updated by new function evaluations. An acquisition strategy uses this posterior distribution to decide where to place the next function evaluation. We propose a novel Bayesian optimization framework for situations where the user controls the computational effort, and therefore the precision of the function evaluations. This is a common situation in econometrics where the marginal likelihood is often computed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, with the precision of the marginal likelihood estimate determined by the number of MCMC draws. The proposed acquisition strategy gives the optimizer the option to explore the function with cheap noisy evaluations and therefore finds the optimum faster. Prior hyperparameter estimation in the steady-state Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model on US macroeconomic time series data is used for illustration. The proposed method is shown to find the optimum much quicker than traditional Bayesian optimization or grid search.},

  abstract = {We study the factors affecting training time in multi-device deep learning systems. Given a specification of a convolutional neural network, our goal is to minimize the time to train this model on a cluster of commodity CPUs and GPUs. We first focus on the single-node setting and show that by using standard batching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least 5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training speed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its underlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black box. Our second contribution is a theoretical and empirical study of the tradeoffs affecting end-to-end training time in a multiple-device setting. We identify the degree of asynchronous parallelization as a key factor affecting both hardware and statistical efficiency. We see that asynchrony can be viewed as introducing a momentum term. Our results imply that tuning momentum is critical in asynchronous parallel configurations, and suggest that published results that have not been fully tuned might report suboptimal performance for some configurations. For our third contribution, we use our novel understanding of the interaction between system and optimization dynamics to provide an efficient hyperparameter optimizer. Our optimizer involves a predictive model for the total time to convergence and selects an allocation of resources to minimize that time. We demonstrate that the most popular distributed deep learning systems fall within our tradeoff space, but do not optimize within the space. By doing this optimization, our prototype runs 1.9x to 12x faster than the fastest state-of-the-art systems.},

We refer to these data as replicated spatial passing networks---to accurately model such data it is necessary to take into account the spatial positions of the passer and receiver for each passing event. This spatial registration and replicates that occur across games represent key differences with usual social network data. As a key step before investigating how the passing dynamics influence team performance, we focus on developing methods for summarizing different team's passing strategies. Our proposed approach relies on a novel multiresolution data representation framework and Poisson nonnegative block term decomposition model, which automatically produces coarse-to-fine low-rank network motifs. The proposed methods are applied to detailed passing record data collected from the 2014 FIFA World Cup.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel approach to the problem of clustering hierarchically aggregated time-series data, which has remained an understudied problem though it has several commercial applications. We first group time series at each aggregated level, while simultaneously leveraging local and global information. The proposed method can cluster hierarchical time series (HTS) with different lengths and structures. For common two-level hierarchies, we employ a combined objective for local and global clustering over spaces of discrete probability measures, using Wasserstein distance coupled with Soft-DTW divergence. For multi-level hierarchies, we present a bottom-up procedure that progressively leverages lower-level information for higher-level clustering. Our final goal is to improve both the accuracy and speed of forecasts for a larger number of HTS needed for a real-world application. To attain this goal, each time series is first assigned the forecast for its cluster representative, which can be considered as a "shrinkage prior" for the set of time series it represents. Then this base forecast can be quickly fine-tuned to adjust to the specifics of that time series. We empirically show that our method substantially improves performance in terms of both speed and accuracy for large-scale forecasting tasks involving much HTS.},

However, existing forms of SVGD cannot be directly applied to discrete distributions. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a simple yet general framework that transforms discrete distributions to equivalent piecewise continuous distributions, on which the gradient-free SVGD is applied to perform efficient approximate inference. The empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional algorithms such as Gibbs sampling and discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on various challenging benchmarks of discrete graphical models. We demonstrate that our method provides a promising tool for learning ensembles of binarized neural network (BNN), outperforming other widely used ensemble methods on learning binarized AlexNet on CIFAR10 dataset. In addition, such transform can be straightforwardly employed in gradientfree kernelized Stein discrepancy to perform goodness-of-fit (GOF) test on discrete distributions. Our proposed method outperforms existing GOF test methods for intractable discrete distributions.},

  abstract = {In light of widespread evidence of parameter instability in macroeconomic models, many time-varying parameter (TVP) models have been proposed. This paper proposes a nonparametric TVP-VAR model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The novelty of this model arises from the law of motion driving the parameters being treated nonparametrically. This leads to great flexibility in the nature and extent of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and in the conditional variance. In contrast to other nonparametric and machine learning methods that are black box, inference using our model is straightforward because, in treating the parameters rather than the variables nonparametrically, the model remains conditionally linear in the mean. Parsimony is achieved through adopting nonparametric factor structures and use of shrinkage priors. In an application to US macroeconomic data, we illustrate the use of our model in tracking both the evolving nature of the Phillips curve and how the effects of business cycle shocks on inflationary measures vary nonlinearly with movements in uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Hayashi’s Econometrics promises to be the next great synthesis of modern econometrics. It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.},

In general, two limitations associated with g-andh transformations are that their probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) are unknown. In view of this, the g-and-h transformations’ pdfs and cdfs are derived in general parametric form. Moments are also derived and it is subsequently shown how the g and h parameters can be determined for prespecified values of skew and kurtosis. Numerical examples and parametric plots of g-and-h pdfs and cdfs are provided to confirm and demonstrate the methodology. It is also shown how g-and-h distributions can be used in the context of distribution fitting using real data sets.},

  abstract = {Multivariate extreme value theory and methods concern the characterization, estimation and extrapolation of the joint tail of the distribution of a d-dimensional random variable. Existing approaches are based on limiting arguments in which all components of the variable become large at the same rate. This limit approach is inappropriate when the extreme values of all the variables are unlikely to occur together or when interest is in regions of the support of the joint distribution where only a subset of components is extreme. In practice this restricts existing methods to applications where d is typically 2 or 3. Under an assumption about the asymptotic form of the joint distribution of a d-dimensional random variable conditional on its having an extreme component, we develop an entirely new semiparametric approach which overcomes these existing restrictions and can be applied to problems of any dimension. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and its advantages over existing methods by using theoretical examples and simulation studies. The approach is used to analyse air pollution data and reveals complex extremal dependence behaviour that is consistent with scientific understanding of the process. We find that the dependence structure exhibits marked seasonality, with extremal dependence between some pollutants being significantly greater than the dependence at non-extreme levels.},

Our approach involves constructing a pair of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains that are coupled in such a way that they meet exactly after some random number of iterations. These chains can then be combined so that the resulting estimators are unbiased. This allows us to produce independent replicates in parallel and average them to obtain estimators that are consistent in the limit of the number of replicates, rather than in the usual limit of the number of Markov chain iterations. We investigate the scalability of our coupling in high dimensions on a toy example. The choice of algorithmic parameters and the efficiency of our proposed approach are then illustrated on a logistic regression with 300 covariates and a log-Gaussian Cox point processes model with low- to fine-grained discretizations.},

  abstract = {Posterior inference with an intractable likelihood is becoming an increasingly common task in scientific domains which rely on sophisticated computer simulations. Typically, these mechanistic models do not admit tractable densities forcing practitioners to rely on approximations during inference. This work proposes a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and the marginal model. We achieve this by learning a flexible estimator which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. The resulting amortized ratio estimator is embedded in MCMC samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to approximate the likelihoodratio between consecutive states in the Markov chain, allowing us to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are presented to improve the numerical stability. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of benchmarks and compare against well-established approximate inference techniques. Scientific applications in high energy and astrophysics with high-dimensional observations show its applicability.},

  abstract = {The general projected normal distribution is a simple and intuitive model for directional data in any dimension: a multivariate normal random vector divided by its length is the projection of that vector onto the surface of the unit hypersphere. Observed data consist of the projections, but not the lengths. Inference for this model has been restricted to the two-dimensional (circular) case, using Bayesian methods with data augmentation to generate the latent lengths and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to sample from the posterior. We describe a new parameterization of the general projected normal distribution that makes inference in any dimension tractable, including the important three-dimensional (spherical) case, which has not previously been considered. Under this new parameterization, the full conditionals of the unknown parameters have closed forms, and we propose a new slice sampler to draw the latent lengths without the need for rejection. Gibbs sampling with this new scheme is fast and easy, leading to improved Bayesian inference; for example, it is now feasible to conduct model selection among complex mixture and regression models for large data sets. Our parameterization also allows straightforward incorporation of covariates into the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal, increasing the ability of the model to explain directional data as a function of independent regressors. Circular and spherical cases are considered in detail and illustrated with scientific applications. For the circular case, seasonal variation in time-of-day departures of anglers from recreational fishing sites is modeled using covariates in both the mean vector and covariance matrix. For the spherical case, we consider paired angles that describe the relative positions of carbon atoms along the backbone chain of a protein. We fit mixtures of general projected normals to these data, with the best-fitting mixture accurately describing biologically meaningful structures including helices, β-sheets, and coils and turns. Finally, we show via simulation that our methodology has satisfactory performance in some 10-dimensional and 50-dimensional problems.},

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient “turnkey” samplers.},

In contrast to existing approaches, our structure allows the analysis and assessment of the forecast value added at each hierarchical level. Our reconciled forecasts are inherently probabilistic, whether probabilistic base forecasts are used or not.},

We highlight the predictive nature of Bayesian models and the symmetry assumptions implied by beliefs of an underlying exchangeable sequence of observations. By taking a closer look at the Bayesian bootstrap, the parametric bootstrap of Efron and a version of Bayesian thinking about inference uncovered by Doob based on martingales, we introduce a parametric Bayesian bootstrap. Martingales play a fundamental role. Illustrations are presented as is the relevant theory.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates how to apply the method of coupling from the past (CFTP) (Propp and Wilson, 1996) to the problem of sampling orthogonal predictors in the Bayes linear model. Using CFTP we construct a coupled Gibbs sampler that automatically determines its own run time to convergence. This removes the need to rely on approximate convergence diagnostics as in usual Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We apply this approach to a number of curve and surface tting examples using wavelets and Demmler-Reinsch smoothing splines where there are as many predictors as data points. The DemmlerReinsch splines are derived from an orthogonalization of some standard smoothing models. Somewhat remarkably, this procedure actually adds to the transparency of the model. This proves especially bene cial in a Bayesian perspective as it facilitates the quanti cation of prior beliefs on the model space. A striking result in all of our examples is the rapid convergence of the Gibbs sampler. Possessing this knowledge allows us to repeatedly regenerate the sampler following known convergence and hence generate independent and identically distributed samples from the posterior model space.},

The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},

Fractionally differenced processes exhibit long-term persistence and antipersistence; the dependence between observations a long time span apart decays much more slowly with time span than is the case with the more commonly studied time series models. Long-term persistent processes have applications in economics and hydrology; compared to existing models of long-term persistence, the family of models introduced here offers much greater flexibility in the simultaneous modelling of the short-term and long-term behaviour of a time series.},

  abstract = {Dropout, a stochastic regularisation technique for training of neural networks, has recently been reinterpreted as a specific type of approximate inference algorithm for Bayesian neural networks. The main contribution of the reinterpretation is in providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing and extending the algorithm. We show that the proposed framework suffers from several issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior related to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due to singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational Gaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that the algorithm still works only because the variational formulation annuls some of the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL) divergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of high-dimensional distributions. We show that motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit. Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically and on a simple practical example which shows that the QKLoptimal approximation of a full rank Gaussian with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal Component Analysis solution.},

The method is based on a kriging metamodel that provides a global prediction of the objective values and a measure of prediction uncertainty at every point. The criterion for the infill sample selection is an augmented expected improvement function with desirable properties for stochastic responses. The method is empirically compared with the revised simplex search, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, and the DIRECT methods using six test problems from the literature. An application case study on an inventory system is also documented. The results suggest that the proposed method has excellent consistency and efficiency in finding global optimal solutions, and is particularly useful for expensive systems.},

Earlier studies documented widespread spillover of the reputation effect, suggesting a strong commonality in Big 5 audit practices. We examine whether the market is more discriminating in its assessments. We focus on the roles industry specialization of auditors and the geography of clients’ audit offices play in accounting for the contagion. Our results are supportive of investors who differentiate audit practices by industry and who account for the location of the specific office where the audit work is done. We find that losses suffered by energy firms or firms located close to Houston are equivalent to approximately 90\% of the aggregate abnormal losses suffered by Big 5 clients. Our evidence suggests the possibility of more localized impact of accounting scandals and supports accounting regulations targeted at individual industries.},

  abstract = {Significance             Clustering, in essence, was a tool for describing spatial characteristics in the objects of concern. However, from social to biological studies, researchers’ interests in temporal characteristics often rival their interests in spatial features. Previous efforts to incorporate time information into clustering primarily relied on coding the time information into similarity metrics, thus reducing the problem into the classical paradigm of spatial clustering. The limitation is that the clustering outcomes are often time invariant. Here, we initiate a class of statistical methods that simultaneously infer spatial and temporal groupings. Such methods explicitly model the time dependencies of clustering indices over time. Our method inferred three genes to be associated with the earliest cell fate decision, which was corroborated by experimental validations.           ,              Both spatial characteristics and temporal features are often the subjects of concern in physical, social, and biological studies. This work tackles the clustering problems for time course data in which the cluster number and clustering structure change with respect to time, dubbed time-variant clustering. We developed a hierarchical model that simultaneously clusters the objects at every time point and describes the relationships of the clusters between time points. The hidden layer of this model is a generalized form of branching processes. A reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was implemented for model inference, and a feature selection procedure was developed. We applied this method to explore an open question in preimplantation embryonic development. Our analyses using single-cell gene expression data suggested that the earliest cell fate decision could start at the 4-cell stage in mice, earlier than the commonly thought 8- to 16-cell stage. These results together with independent experimental data from single-cell RNA-seq provided support against a prevailing hypothesis in mammalian development.},

  abstract = {Distributed statistical inference has recently attracted enormous attention. Many existing work focuses on the averaging estimator, e.g., Zhang and Duchi (J Mach Learn Res 14:3321–3363, 2013) together with many others. We propose a one-step approach to enhance a simple-averaging based distributed estimator by utilizing a single Newton–Raphson updating. We derive the corresponding asymptotic properties of the newly proposed estimator. We find that the proposed one-step estimator enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the idealized centralized estimator. In particular, the asymptotic normality was established for the proposed estimator, while other competitors may not enjoy the same property. The proposed one-step approach merely requires one additional round of communication in relative to the averaging estimator; so the extra communication burden is insignificant. The proposed one-step approach leads to a lower upper bound of the mean squared error than other alternatives. In finite sample cases, numerical examples show that the proposed estimator outperforms the simple averaging estimator with a large margin in terms of the sample mean squared error. A potential application of the one-step approach is that one can use multiple machines to speed up large scale statistical inference with little compromise in the quality of estimators. The proposed method becomes more valuable when data can only be available at distributed machines with limited communication bandwidth.},

Classical Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration require a bound or estimate of the variance in order to determine the quality of the output. The method called the product estimator does not require knowledge of the variance in order to produce a result of guaranteed quality, but requires a cooling schedule that must have certain strict properties. Finding a cooling schedule can be difficult, and finding an optimal cooling schedule is usually computationally out of reach. TPA is a method that solves this difficulty, creating an optimal cooling schedule automatically as it is run. This method has its own set of requirements; here it is shown how to meet these requirements for problems arising in Bayesian inference. This gives guaranteed accuracy for integrated likelihoods and posterior means of nonnegative parameters.},

The resulting Bayesian additive vector autoregressive tree (BAVART) model is capable of capturing arbitrary nonlinear relations between the endogenous variables and the covariates without much input from the researcher. Since controlling for heteroscedasticity is key for producing precise density forecasts, our model allows for stochastic volatility in the errors. We apply our model to two datasets. The first application shows that the BAVART model yields highly competitive forecasts of the U.S. term structure of interest rates. In a second application we estimate our model using a moderately sized Eurozone dataset to investigate the dynamic effects of uncertainty on the economy.},

We use bonds’ excess credit spread as a proxy for stocks’ default risk to control for the changing non-diversifiable option-risk characteristic of stocks. Because sensitivity to the excess credit spread becomes smaller as size increases and as value decreases, excess credit spread explains the CAPM anomalies in a fashion similar to the Fama–French factors. While the excess credit spread is significant in explaining Fama and French’s size and value effects, adding the Fama–French factors does not improve the performance of our model. Our revised model resembles conditional CAPM, but it offers a more intuitive explanation for the size and value effects.},

This approach features a division of the large scale data set into smaller ones with manageable sizes, based on their physical locations, and fit a local model in each area. The local model estimates are then combined sequentially from the specified multilevel models using our novel bottom-up approach for parameter estimation. The prediction, on the other hand, is implemented in a top-down matter. The proposed method is applied to the solar energy prediction problem for the U.S. Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative.},

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

  abstract = {Large-scale distributed training of neural networks is often limited by network bandwidth, wherein the communication time overwhelms the local computation time. Motivated by the success of sketching methods in sub-linear/streaming algorithms, we introduce SKETCHED-SGD4, an algorithm for carrying out distributed SGD by communicating sketches instead of full gradients. We show that SKETCHED-SGD has favorable convergence rates on several classes of functions. When considering all communication – both of gradients and of updated model weights – SKETCHEDSGD reduces the amount of communication required compared to other gradient compression methods from O(d) or O(W ) to O(log d), where d is the number of model parameters and W is the number of workers participating in training. We run experiments on a transformer model, an LSTM, and a residual network, demonstrating up to a 40x reduction in total communication cost with no loss in final model performance. We also show experimentally that SKETCHED-SGD scales to at least 256 workers without increasing communication cost or degrading model performance.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide consistent approximations of integrals as the number of iterations goes to infinity. MCMC estimators are generally biased after any fixed number of iterations, which complicates both parallel computation and the construction of confidence intervals. We propose to remove this bias by using couplings of Markov chains together with a telescopic sum argument of Glynn and Rhee (2014). The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently on parallel processors. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the proposed estimators and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a highdimensional variable selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

  abstract = {Hospitalized self-inflicted firearm injuries have not been extensively studied, particularly regarding clinical diagnoses at the index admission. The objective of this study was to discover the diagnostic phenotypes (DPs) or clusters of hospitalized self-inflicted firearm injuries. Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data in the US from 1993 to 2014, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to identify self-inflicted firearm injuries among those ≥18 years of age. The 25 most frequent diagnostic codes were used to compute a dissimilarity matrix and the optimal number of clusters. We used hierarchical clustering to identify the main DPs. The overall cohort included 14072 hospitalizations, with self-inflicted firearm injuries occurring mainly in those between 16 to 45 years of age, black, with co-occurring tobacco and alcohol use, and mental illness. Out of the three identified DPs, DP1 was the largest (n=10,110), and included most common diagnoses similar to overall cohort, including major depressive disorders (27.7\%), hypertension (16.8\%), acute post hemorrhagic anemia (16.7\%), tobacco (15.7\%) and alcohol use (12.6\%). DP2 (n=3,725) was not characterized by any of the top 25 ICD-9 diagnoses codes, and included children and peripartum women. DP3, the smallest phenotype (n=237), had high prevalence of depression similar to DP1, and defined by fewer fatal injuries of chest and abdomen. There were three distinct diagnostic phenotypes in hospitalizations due to self-inflicted firearm injuries. Further research is needed to determine how DPs can be used to tailor clinical care and prevention efforts.},

In particular, the degrees of freedom is often used to parameterize the bias-variance trade-off in model selection. We argue that, on the contrary, model complexity and degrees of freedom may correspond very poorly. We exhibit and theoretically explore various fitting procedures for which the degrees of freedom is not monotonic in the model complexity parameter and can exceed the total dimension of the ambient space even in very simple settings. We show that the degrees of freedom for any nonconvex projection method can be unbounded.},

However, the nonsmooth quantile loss poses new challenges to distributed estimation in both computation and theoretical development. To address this challenge, we use a convolution-type smoothing approach and its Taylor expression to transform the nondifferentiable quantile loss function into a convex quadratic loss function, which admits a fast and scalable algorithm to perform optimization under massive and high-dimensional data. The proposed distributed estimators are both computationally and communication efficient. Moreover, only the gradient information is communicated at each iteration. Theoretically, we show that, after a certain number of iterations, the resulting estimator is statistically as efficient as the global estimator without any restriction on the number of machines. Both simulations and data analysis are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Estimating the rank of the coefficient matrix is a major challenge in multivariate regression, including vector autoregression (VAR). In this paper, we develop a novel fully Bayesian approach that allows for rank estimation. The key to our approach is reparameterizing the coefficient matrix using its singular value decomposition and conducting Bayesian inference on the decomposed parameters. By implementing a stochastic search variable selection on the singular values of the coefficient matrix, the ultimate selected rank can be identified as the number of nonzero singular values. Our approach is appropriate for small multivariate regressions as well as for higher dimensional models with up to about 40 predictors. In macroeconomic forecasting using VARs, the advantages of shrinkage through proper Bayesian priors are well documented. Consequently, the shrinkage approach proposed here that selects or averages over low rank coefficient matrices is evaluated in a forecasting environment. We show in both simulations and empirical studies that our Bayesian approach provides forecasts that are highly competitive against two of the most promising benchmark methods, dynamic factor models and factor augmented VARs.},

  abstract = {This paper develops particle filtering and learning for sequential inference in empirical asset pricing models. We provide a computationally feasible toolset for sequential parameter learning, hypothesis testing, and model monitoring, incorporating multiple observable variables, unobserved stochastic volatility, and unobserved “drifting” regression coefficients. Sequential inference allows us to observe how the views of economic decision makers evolve in real time. Empirically, we analyze time series predictability of equity returns, using both the traditional dividend yield and net payout yield, which incorporates issuances and repurchases. We find that the data rejects the traditional model for both predictors, in favor of models with drifting coefficients or stochastic volatility. We study the optimal portfolio allocation problem under parameter, state variable, and model uncertainty, and show that the Bayesian portfolios are more stable and have better out-of-sample performance than rolling regressions.},

  abstract = {Modeling the dependency between stock market returns is a difficult task when returns follow a complicated dynamics. When returns are non-normal, it is often simply impossible to specify the multivariate distribution relating two or more return series. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on copula functions, which consists in estimating first the univariate distributions and then the joining distribution. In such a context, the dependency parameter can easily be rendered conditional and time varying. We apply this methodology to the daily returns of four major stock markets. Our results suggest that conditional dependency depends on past realizations for European market pairs only. For these markets, dependency is found to be more widely affected when returns move in the same direction than when they move in opposite directions. Modeling the dynamics of the dependency parameter also suggests that dependency is higher and more persistent between European stock markets.},

We also introduce a purely unanticipated event, in the form of a large jump in a company’s CDS spread, and find that this leads to the strongest evidence of credit contagion across the industry. These results have important implications for the construction of portfolios with creditsensitive instruments.},

This paper provides the first empirical analysis of credit contagion via direct counterparty effects. We find that bankruptcy announce ments cause negative abnormal equity returns and increases in CDS spreads for credi tors. In addition, creditors with large exposures are more likely to suffer from financial distress later. This suggests that counterparty risk is a potential additional channel of credit contagion. Indeed, the fear of counterparty defaults among financial institu tions explains the sudden worsening of the credit crisis after the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008.},

  abstract = {We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of Bayes factors or posterior probabilities of a model given the data is to consider the hypotheses or models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focuses on the probability or weight of a given hypothesis within the mixture model. We analyse the sensitivity of the posterior distribution of the weights induced by different priors on these quantities. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley–Jeffreys paradox. For example, a reference Beta B(a0, a0) prior on the mixture weights can be used for the common problem of testing two contrasting hypotheses or models. In this case the sensitivity of the posterior estimates of the weights to the choice of a0 vanishes as the sample size increases. We therefore advocate a default choice of a0 = 0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Similar results apply for testing more than two alternatives. Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.},

  abstract = {Softmax is an output activation function for modeling categorical probability distributions in many applications of deep learning. However, a recent study revealed that softmax can be a bottleneck of representational capacity of neural networks in language modeling (the softmax bottleneck). In this paper, we propose an output activation function for breaking the softmax bottleneck without additional parameters. We re-analyze the softmax bottleneck from the perspective of the output set of log-softmax and identify the cause of the softmax bottleneck. On the basis of this analysis, we propose sigsoftmax, which is composed of a multiplication of an exponential function and sigmoid function. Sigsoftmax can break the softmax bottleneck. The experiments on language modeling demonstrate that sigsoftmax and mixture of sigsoftmax outperform softmax and mixture of softmax, respectively.},

The evaluation of these new methods requires either collecting or simulating a diverse set of time series benchmarking data to enable reliable comparisons against alternative approaches. We propose GeneRAting TIme Series with diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models. We simulate sets of time series using MAR models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models, GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as time series forecasting and classification. We illustrate the usefulness of our time series generation process through a time series forecasting application.},

However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach — ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction intervals.},

  abstract = {Forecast combinations have been widely applied in the last few decades to improve forecasting. Estimating optimal weights that can outperform simple averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of using time series features for forecast combinations has flourished. Although this idea has been proved to be beneficial in several forecasting competitions, it may not be practical in many situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate features to build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated based on the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the future. Other times, the estimation of the features is infeasible due to limited historical data. In this work, we suggest a change of focus from the historical data to the produced forecasts to extract features. We use out-of-sample forecasts to obtain weights for forecast combinations by amplifying the diversity of the pool of methods being combined. A rich set of time series is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our diversity-based forecast combination framework not only simplifies the modeling process but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency, elements that are important from both an optimization and a decision analysis perspective.},

  abstract = {We present the parallel and interacting stochastic approximation annealing (PISAA) algorithm, a stochastic simulation procedure for global optimisation, that extends and improves the stochastic approximation annealing (SAA) by using population Monte Carlo ideas. The standard SAA algorithm guarantees convergence to the global minimum when a square-root cooling schedule is used; however the efficiency of its performance depends crucially on its self-adjusting mechanism. Because its mechanism is based on information obtained from only a single chain, SAA may present slow convergence in complex optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm involves simulating a population of SAA chains that interact each other in a manner that ensures significant improvement of the self-adjusting mechanism and better exploration of the sampling space. Central to the proposed algorithm are the ideas of (i) recycling information from the whole population of Markov chains to design a more accurate/stable self-adjusting mechanism and (ii) incorporating more advanced proposals, such as crossover operations, for the exploration of the sampling space. PISAA presents a significantly improved performance in terms of convergence. PISAA can be implemented in parallel computing environments if available. We demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithm on challenging applications including Bayesian network learning and protein folding. Our numerical comparisons suggest that PISAA outperforms the simulated annealing, stochastic approximation annealing, and annealing evolutionary stochastic approximation Monte Carlo especially in high dimensional or rugged scenarios.},

We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation.

  abstract = {Multivariate factor stochastic volatility (SV) models are increasingly used for the analysis of multivariate financial and economic time series because they can capture the volatility dynamics by a small number of latent factors. The main advantage of such a model is its parsimony, as the variances and covariances of a time series vector are governed by a low-dimensional common factor with the components following independent SV models. For high-dimensional problems of this kind, Bayesian MCMC estimation is a very efficient estimation method; however, it is associated with a considerable computational burden when the dimensionality of the data is moderate to large. To overcome this, we avoid the usual forward-filtering backward-sampling (FFBS) algorithm by sampling “all without a loop” (AWOL), consider various reparameterizations such as (partial) noncentering, and apply an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy (ASIS) for boosting MCMC estimation at a univariate level, which can be applied directly to heteroskedasticity estimation for latent variables such as factors. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the model to a vector of daily exchange rate data.},

  abstract = {We discuss efficient Bayesian estimation of dynamic covariance matrices in multivariate time series through a factor stochastic volatility model. In particular, we propose two interweaving strategies (Yu and Meng, 2011) to substantially accelerate convergence and mixing of standard MCMC approaches. Similar to marginal data augmentation techniques, the proposed acceleration procedures exploit non-identifiability issues which frequently arise in factor models. Our new interweaving strategies are easy to implement and come at almost no extra computational cost; nevertheless, they can boost estimation efficiency by several orders of magnitude as is shown in extensive simulation studies. To conclude, the application of our algorithm to a 26-dimensional exchange rate data set illustrates the superior performance of the new approach for real-world data.},

Three features are introduced to permit reliable estimation of the model. First, we assume that the reduced-form errors in the VAR feature a factor stochastic volatility structure, allowing for conditional equation-by-equation estimation. Second, we apply recently developed global-local shrinkage priors to the VAR coefficients to cure the curse of dimensionality. Third, we utilize recent innovations to efficiently sample from high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions. This makes simulationbased fully Bayesian inference feasible when the dimensionality is large but the time series length is moderate. We demonstrate the merits of our approach in an extensive simulation study and apply the model to US macroeconomic data to evaluate its forecasting capabilities.},

Accurate wind speed forecasts are necessary to schedule dispatchable generation and tariffs in the day-ahead electricity market. This paper examines the use of fractional-ARIMA or f-ARIMA models to model, and forecast wind speeds on the day-ahead (24 h) and two-day-ahead (48 h) horizons. The models are applied to wind speed records obtained from four potential wind generation sites in North Dakota. The forecasted wind speeds are used in conjunction with the power curve of an operational (NEG MICON, 750 kW) turbine to obtain corresponding forecasts of wind power production. The forecast errors in wind speed/power are analyzed and compared with the persistence model. Results indicate that significant improvements in forecasting accuracy are obtained with the proposed models compared to the persistence method.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

  abstract = {When standard optimization methods fail to find a satisfactory solution for a parameter fitting problem, a tempting recourse is to adjust parameters manually. While tedious, this approach can be surprisingly powerful in terms of achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions. This paper outlines an optimization algorithm, Adaptive Stochastic Descent (ASD), that has been designed to replicate the essential aspects of manual parameter fitting in an automated way. Specifically, ASD uses simple principles to form probabilistic assumptions about (a) which parameters have the greatest effect on the objective function, and (b) optimal step sizes for each parameter. We show that for a certain class of optimization problems (namely, those with a moderate to large number of scalar parameter dimensions, especially if some dimensions are more important than others), ASD is capable of minimizing the objective function with far fewer function evaluations than classic optimization methods, such as the Nelder-Mead nonlinear simplex, Levenberg-Marquardt gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. As a case study, we show that ASD outperforms standard algorithms when used to determine how resources should be allocated in order to minimize new HIV infections in Swaziland.},

  abstract = {Forensic science plays a critical role in the United States criminal legal system. Historically, however, most feature-based fields of forensic science, including firearms examination and latent print analysis, have not been shown to be scientifically valid. Recently, black-box studies have been proposed as a means of assessing whether these feature-based disciplines are valid, at least in terms of accuracy, reproducibility and repeatability. In these studies, forensic examiners frequently either do not respond to every test item or select an answer equivalent to ‘don’t know’. Current black-box studies do not account for these high levels of missingness in statistical analyses. Unfortunately, the authors of black-box studies typically do not share the data necessary to meaningfully adjust estimates for the high proportion of missing responses. Borrowing from work in the context of small area estimation, we propose the use of hierarchical Bayesian models that do not require auxiliary data to adjust for non-response. Using these models, we offer the first formal exploration of the impact that missingness is playing in error rate estimations reported in black-box studies. We show that error rates currently reported as low as 0.4\% could actually be at least 8.4\% in models accounting for non-response where inconclusive decisions are counted as correct, and over 28\% when inconclusives are counted as missing responses. These proposed models are not the answer to the missingness problem in black-box studies. But with the release of auxiliary information, they can be the foundation for new methodologies to adjust for missingness in error rate estimations.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Participants in electricity markets face a substantial amount of uncertainty, and with Increased penetration of volatile renewable generation this uncertainty has further increased. Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market. Recently, an alternative so-called stochastic settlement market has been proposed (see, e.g., Pritchard et al. 2010 [Pritchard G, Zakeri G, Philpott A (2010) A single-settlement, energy-only electric power market for unpredictable and intermittent participants. Oper. Res. 58(4):1210-1219.] and Bouffard et al. 2005 [Bouffard F, Galiana FD, Conejo AJ (2005) Market-clearing with stochastic security-Part I: Formulation. IEEE Trans. Power Systems 20(4):1818-1826.]) where the ISO clears both stages in one single settlement market.\& para;\& para;While the effectiveness of the stochastic market clearing mechanism is clear when the market is competitive, this is open to question for imperfectly competitive markets. In this paper we consider simplified models for two types of market clearing mechanisms. First, a market clearing mechanism utilized in New Zealand, whereby firms offer in advance and are notified of a clearing quantity and price guide based on an estimate of demand, followed by real-time dispatch. We refer to this as NZTS. Secondly we consider a simplified stochastic programming market clearing mechanism. We compute Nash equilibria of games resulting from each of the market clearing mechanisms. We prove that under the assumption of symmetry, our simplified stochastic programming market clearing is equivalent to a two-period single settlement system that takes account of deviation penalties in the second stage. These, however, differ from NZTS. We show that when we assume symmetry, this stochastic settlement model results in better social welfare than does NZTS. We also investigate a number of asymmetric examples numerically.},

Classical model distance measures require multivariate integration and thus suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we provide numerically tractable methods to measure the distance between two vine copulas even in high dimensions. For this purpose, we consecutively develop three new distance measures based on the Kullback–Leibler distance, using the result that it can be expressed as the sum over expectations of KL distances between univariate conditional densities, which can be easily obtained for vine copulas. To reduce numerical calculations, we approximate these expectations on adequately designed grids, outperforming Monte Carlo integration with respect to computational time. For the sake of interpretability, we provide a baseline calibration for the proposed distance measures. We further develop similar substitutes for the Jeffreys distance, a symmetrized version of the Kullback–Leibler distance. In numerous examples and applications, we illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the developed distance measures.},

However, due to the lack of efficient Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling from the posterior of deep neural networks (DNNs), Bayesian deep learning has not yet powered our AI system. We propose a class of adaptive stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) algorithms, where the drift function is biased to enhance escape from saddle points and the bias is adaptively adjusted according to the gradient of past samples. We establish the convergence of the proposed algorithms under mild conditions, and demonstrate via numerical examples that the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the existing SGMCMC algorithms, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and preconditioned SGLD, in both simulation and optimization tasks.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = {Technological advances in the past decade, hardware and software alike, have made access to high-performance computing (HPC) easier than ever. We review these advances from a statistical computing perspective. Cloud computing allows access to supercomputers affordable. Deep learning software libraries make programming statistical algorithms easy, and enable users to write code once and run it anywhere from a laptop to a workstation with multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) or a supercomputer in a cloud. To promote statisticians to benefit from these developments, we review recent optimization algorithms that are useful for high-dimensional models and can harness the power of HPC. Code snippets are provided for the readers to grasp the ease of programming. We also provide an easy-to-use distributed matrix data structure suitable for HPC. Employing this data structure, we illustrate various statistical applications including large-scale nonnegative matrix factorization, positron emission tomography, multidimensional scaling, and 1-regularized Cox regression. Our examples easily scale up to an 8-GPU workstation and a 720-CPU-core cluster in a cloud. As a case in point, we analyze the on-set of type-2 diabetes from the UK Biobank with 200,000 subjects and about 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms using the HPC 1-regularized Cox regression. Fitting a half-million-variate model takes less than 45 minutes, reconfirming known associations. To our knowledge, the feasibility of jointly genome-wide association analysis of survival outcomes at this scale is first demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Self-exciting Hawkes processes are used to model events which cluster in time and space, and have been widely studied in seismology under the name of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. In the ETAS framework, the occurrence of the mainshock earthquakes in a geographical region is assumed to follow an inhomogeneous spatial point process, and aftershock events are then modelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters due to the complexity of the likelihood function, and the difficulty in estimating an appropriate mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the spatial mainshock process. Direct inference for the resulting model is problematic due to the strong correlation of the parameters for the mainshock and triggering processes, so we instead use an auxiliary latent variable routine to perform efficient inference.},

  abstract = {Various economic theories are available to explain the existence of credit and default cycles. There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macroeconomic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933–1997 US data on real GDP, credit spreads and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit and business cycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, corresponding to periods of around 6 and 11–16 years, respectively. Cyclical co-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at the longer frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicality is less clearcut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive and negative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. This pattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World War II period. We comment on the implications of our findings for credit risk management. Copyright  2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We also detect significant longer term movements in default rates and default correlations. In a multi-year backtest experiment we show that accommodation of default rate dynamics has important consequences for credit risk capitalization requirements. Static or myopic variants of credit portfolio models miss significant periods of credit risk accumulation. Empirically congruent dynamic models by contrast provide more timely warning signals of credit risk build-up. In this way they may mitigate some of the pro-cyclicality concerns.},

While this method introduces an asymptotic bias, we show that this bias can be controlled and is more than offset by a decrease in variance due to our ability to draw more samples per unit of time.},

The forecasting literature, often disjoint from the needs of the forecast users, has focused on providing optimal models in terms of likelihood and various accuracy metrics. However, there is evidence that this does not always lead to better inventory performance, as often the translation between forecast errors and inventory results is not linear. In this study, we consider an approach to parametrising forecasting models by directly considering appropriate inventory metrics and the current inventory policy. We propose a way to combine the competing multiple inventory objectives, i.e. meeting demand, while eliminating excessive stock, and use the resulting cost function to identify inventory optimal parameters for forecasting models. We evaluate the proposed parametrisation against established alternatives and demonstrate its performance on real data. Furthermore, we explore the connection between forecast accuracy and inventory performance and discuss the extent to which the former is an appropriate proxy of the latter.},

However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent, but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate for producing forecasts with such features. We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.},

In particular, we provide a realistic model of financial distress: firstly, we model Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies as different possible outcomes of financial distress. Secondly, we take into consideration that, in practice, “default” is not the end, but the beginning of financial distress, eventually leading to a reorganization or a liquidation of a distressed firm. Thirdly and most importantly, we are able to analyze the impact of contagion on an investor’s demand for corporate bonds. Contagion is an important phenomenon, as it reduces the investor’s ability to diversify his portfolio, and we show that the bond demand can change by more than 50\%. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Single factor models are used in finance to model the joint behaviour of stocks. The dependence is commonly modeled with a multivariate normal distribution. Krupskii and Joe (2013) provide a copula based extension. This single factor copula requires the specification of bivariate linking copulas. Resulting joint models can accommodate symmetric or asymmetric tail dependence. For modeling multivariate time series we propose a single factor copula model together with stochastic volatility margins. For this model we develop joint Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) within Gibbs sampling. The Bayesian approach allows for high dimensional parameter spaces as they are present here in addition to uncertainty quantification through credible intervals. Furthermore we avoid the two step approach for margins and dependence in copula models as followed by Schamberger et al (2017). In a first simulation study the performance of HMC is compared to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach developed by Schamberger et al (2017) for the copula part. It is shown that HMC considerably outperforms this approach in terms of effective sample size, MSE and observed coverage probabilities. In a second simulation study satisfactory small sample performance is seen for the full HMC within Gibbs procedure. The approach is illustrated for a portfolio of financial assets with respect to one day ahead value at risk forecasts. We provide comparison to a two step estimation procedure of the proposed model and to relevant benchmark models: a model with dynamic linear models for the margins and a single factor copula for the dependence proposed by Schamberger et al (2017) and a multivariate factor stochastic volatility model proposed by Kastner et al (2017). Our proposed approach shows superior performance.},

  abstract = {We propose a class of dynamic vine copula models. This is an extension of static vine copulas and a generalization of dynamic C-vine and D-vine copulas studied by Almeida et al (2016) and Goel and Mehra (2019). Within this class, we allow for time-varying dependence by driving the vine copula parameters with latent AR(1) processes. This modeling approach is very flexible but estimation is not straightforward due to the highdimensional parameter space. We propose a Bayesian estimation approach, which relies on a novel approximation of the posterior distribution. This approximation allows to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as elliptical slice sampling, in a sequential way. In contrast to other Bayesian sequential estimation procedures for vine copula models as proposed by Gruber and Czado (2015), there is no need to collapse copula parameters to point estimates before proceeding to the next tree. Thus more information and uncertainty is propagated from lower to higher trees. A simulation study shows satisfactory performance of the Bayesian procedure. This dynamic modeling and inference approach can be applied in various fields, where static vine copulas have already proven to be successful, including environmental sciences, medicine and finance. Here we study the dependence among 21 exchange rates. For comparison we also estimate a static vine copula model and dynamic C-vine and D-vine copula models. This comparison shows superior performance of the proposed dynamic vine copula model with respect to one day ahead forecasting accuracy.},

  abstract = {A new class of copula models with dynamic dependence is introduced; it can be used when one can assume that there exist a common latent factor that affects all of the observed variables. Conditional on this factor, the distribution of these variables is given by the Gaussian copula with a timevarying correlation matrix, and some observed driving variables can be used to model dynamic correlations. This structure allows one to build flexible and parsimonious models for multivariate data with non-Gaussian dependence that changes over time. The model is computationally tractable in high dimensions and the numerical maximum likelihood estimation is feasible. The proposed class of models is applied to analyze three financial data sets of bond yields, CDS spreads and stock returns. The estimated model is used to construct projected distributions and, for the bond yield and CDS spread datasets, compute the expected maximum number of investments in distress under different scenarios.},

We propose a simple approach based on modeling the distribution of the selected sample as a mixture, with the mixture weights appropriately adjusted, while accounting for uncertainty in the adjustment. We focus for simplicity on Dirichlet process mixtures but the proposed approach can be applied more broadly. We sketch a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for computation, and assess the approach via simulations and an application.},

While most of the existing methods allow some degree of correlations among predictors but do not consider these correlations for variable selection, our method accounts for correlations among the predictors in variable selection. Our correlationbased stochastic search (CBS) method, the hybrid-CBS algorithm, extends a popular search algorithm for high-dimensional data, the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) method. Similar to SSVS, we search the space of all possible models using variable addition, deletion or swap moves. However, our moves through the model space are designed to accommodate correlations among the variables. We describe our approach for continuous, binary, ordinal, and count outcome data. The impact of choices of prior distributions and hyperparameters is assessed in simulation studies. We also examined the performance of variable selection and prediction as the correlation structure of the predictors varies. We found that the hybrid-CBS resulted in lower prediction errors and identified better the true outcome associated predictors than SSVS when predictors were moderately to highly correlated. We illustrate the method on data from a proteomic profiling study of melanoma, a type of skin cancer.},

The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples.

In particular, we allow the dimension of time series N to be as large as, or even larger than, the length of observed time series T . The estimation of the factor loading matrix and the factor process itself is carried out via an eigenanalysis of a N × N nonnegative definite matrix. We show that when all the factors are strong in the sense that the norm of each column in the factor loading matrix is of the order N 1/2, the estimator of the factor loading matrix is weakly consistent in L2-norm with the convergence rate independent of N . Thus the curse is cancelled out by the blessing of dimensionality. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators when factors are not strong. The proposed method together with the asymptotic properties are illustrated in a simulation study. An application to an implied volatility data set, with a trading strategy derived from the fitted factor model, is also reported.},

In the model, individual forecasters have types defined according to a statistical criterion we call type coherence.

We derive the optimal group composition as a function of predictive accuracy, between- and within-type covariance, and group size. Group size plays a critical role in determining the optimal group: in small groups the most accurate type should be in the majority, whereas in large groups the type with the least within-type covariance should dominate.

(2007) (DDKS) who jointly test and reject a specification of firm default intensities and the doubly stochastic assumption in intensity models of default. The method relies on a time change result for counting processes. With an almost identical set of default histories recorded by Moody’s in the period from 1982 to 2006, but using a different specification of the default intensity, we cannot reject the tests based on time change used in DDKS. We then note that the method proposed by DDKS is mainly a misspecification test in that it has very limited power in detecting violations of the doubly stochastic assumption. For example, it will not detect contagion which spreads through the explanatory variables ‘‘covariates” that determine the default intensities of individual firms. Therefore, we perform a different test using a Hawkes process alternative to see if firm-specific variables are affected by occurrences of defaults, but find no evidence of default contagion.},

  abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image superresolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4× upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract = {When huge amounts of data arrive in streams, online updating is an important method to alleviate both computational and data storage issues. The scope of previous research for online updating is extended in the context of the classical linear measurement error model. In the case where some covariates are unknowingly measured with error at the beginning of the stream, but then are measured without error after a particular point along the data stream, the updated estimators ignoring the measurement error are biased for the true parameters. Once the covariates measured without error are first observed, a method to correct the bias of the estimators, as well as to correct the biases in their variance estimator, is proposed; after correction, the traditional online updating method can then proceed as usual. Further, asymptotic distributions for the corrected and updated estimators are established. Simulation studies and a real data analysis with an airline on-time dataset are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Stochastic-gradient-based optimization has been a core enabling methodology in applications to large-scale problems in machine learning and related areas. Despite the progress, the gap between theory and practice remains significant, with theoreticians pursuing mathematical optimality at a cost of obtaining specialized procedures in different regimes (e.g., modulus of strong convexity, magnitude of target accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio), and with practitioners not readily able to know which regime is appropriate to their problem, and seeking broadly applicable algorithms that are reasonably close to optimality. To bridge these perspectives it is necessary to study algorithms that are adaptive to different regimes. We present the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) method for composite convex finite-sum optimization problems and show that SCSG is adaptive to both strong convexity and target accuracy. The adaptivity is achieved by batch variance reduction with adaptive batch sizes and a novel technique, which we referred to as geometrization, which sets the length of each epoch as a geometric random variable. The algorithm achieves strictly better theoretical complexity than other existing adaptive algorithms, while the tuning parameters of the algorithm only depend on the smoothness parameter of the objective.},

Compound distributions have been used to model intermittent demand patterns; there is however a lack of theoretical analysis and little relevant empirical evidence in support of these distributions. In this paper, we conduct a detailed empirical investigation on the goodness of fit of various compound Poisson distributions and we develop a distribution-based demand classification scheme the validity of which is also assessed in empirical terms. Our empirical investigation provides evidence in support of certain demand distributions and the work described in this paper should facilitate the task of selecting such distributions in a real world spare parts inventory context. An extensive discussion on parameter estimation related difficulties in this area is also provided.},

  abstract = {Optimal decision-making compels us to anticipate the future at different horizons. However, in many domains connecting together predictions from multiple time horizons and abstractions levels across their organization becomes all the more important, else decision-makers would be planning using separate and possibly conflicting views of the future. This notably applies to smart grid operation. To optimally manage energy flows in such systems, accurate and coherent predictions must be made across varying aggregation levels and horizons. With this work, we propose a novel multi-dimensional hierarchical forecasting method built upon structurally-informed machine-learning regressors and established hierarchical reconciliation taxonomy. A generic formulation of multi-dimensional hierarchies, reconciling spatial and temporal hierarchies under a common frame is initially defined. Next, a coherency-informed hierarchical learner is developed built upon a custom loss function leveraging optimal reconciliation methods. Coherency of the produced hierarchical forecasts is then secured using similar reconciliation technics. The outcome is a unified and coherent forecast across all examined dimensions. The method is evaluated on two different case studies to predict building electrical loads across spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal hierarchies. Although the regressor natively profits from computationally efficient learning, results displayed disparate performances, demonstrating the value of hierarchical-coherent learning in only one setting. Yet, supported by a comprehensive result analysis, existing obstacles were clearly delineated, presenting distinct pathways for future work. Overall, the paper expands and unites traditionally disjointed hierarchical forecasting methods providing a fertile route toward a novel generation of forecasting regressors.},

We first introduce a random variable called "timeuntil-default" to denote the survival time of each defaultable entity or financial instrument, and define the default correlation between two credit risks as the correlation coefficient between their survival times. Then we argue why a copula function approach should be used to specify the joint distribution of survival times after marginal distributions of survival times are derived from market information, such as risky bond prices or asset swap spreads. The definition and some basic properties of copula functions are given. We show that the current CreditMetrics approach to default correlation through asset correlation is equivalent to using a normal copula function. Finally, we give some numerical examples to illustrate the use of copula functions in the valuation of some credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and first-to-default contracts.},

This paper explores how well a smooth mixture of symmetric components can capture skewed data. Simulations and applications on real data show that including covariate-dependent skewness in the components can lead to substantially improved performance on skewed data, often using a much smaller number of components.

  abstract = {This thesis develops models and associated Bayesian inference methods for flexible univariate and multivariate conditional density estimation. The models are flexible in the sense that they can capture widely differing shapes of the data. The estimation methods are specifically designed to achieve flexibility while still avoiding overfitting. The models are flexible both for a given covariate value, but also across covariate space. A key contribution of this thesis is that it provides general approaches of density estimation with highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The methods are illustrated on several challenging non-linear and non-normal datasets. In the first paper, a general model is proposed for flexibly estimating the density of a continuous response variable conditional on a possibly high-dimensional set of covariates. The model is a finite mixture of asymmetric student-t densities with covariate-dependent mixture weights. The four parameters of the components, the mean, degrees of freedom, scale and skewness, are all modeled as functions of the covariates. The second paper explores how well a smooth mixture of symmetric components can capture skewed data. Simulations and applications on real data show that including covariate-dependent skewness in the components can lead to substantially improved performance on skewed data, often using a much smaller number of components. We also introduce smooth mixtures of gamma and log-normal components to model positively-valued response variables. In the third paper we propose a multivariate Gaussian surface regression model that combines both additive splines and interactive splines, and a highly efficient MCMC algorithm that updates all the multi-dimensional knot locations jointly. We use shrinkage priors to avoid overfitting with different estimated shrinkage factors for the additive and surface part of the model, and also different shrinkage parameters for the different response variables. In the last paper we present a general Bayesian approach for directly modeling dependencies between variables as function of explanatory variables in a flexible copula context. In particular, the Joe-Clayton copula is extended to have covariate-dependent tail dependence and correlations. Posterior inference is carried out using a novel and efficient simulation method. The appendix of the thesis documents the computational implementation details.},

Of particular importance in many areas is the possibility of forecasting the tail-dependences explicitly. Most of the available approaches are only able to estimate tail-dependences and correlations via nuisance parameters, and cannot be used for either interpretation or forecasting. We propose a general Bayesian approach for modeling and forecasting tail-dependences and correlations as explicit functions of covariates, with the aim of improving the copula forecasting performance. The proposed covariate-dependent copula model also allows for Bayesian variable selection from among the covariates of the marginal models, as well as the copula density. The copulas that we study include the Joe-Clayton copula, the Clayton copula, the Gumbel copula and the Student’s t-copula. Posterior inference is carried out using an efficient MCMC simulation method. Our approach is applied to both simulated data and the S\&P 100 and S\&P 600 stock indices. The forecasting performance of the proposed approach is compared with those of other modeling strategies based on log predictive scores. A value-at-risk evaluation is also performed for the model comparisons.},

In this paper, we apply covariate-dependent copula models to assess the dynamic nature of credit risk dependence, which we define as “credit risk clustering”. We also study the driving forces of the credit risk clustering in CEC business group in China. Our empirical analysis shows that the credit risk clustering varies over time and exhibits different patterns across firm pairs in a business group. We also investigate the impacts of systematic and idiosyncratic factors on credit risk clustering. We find that the impacts of the money supply and the short-term interest rates are positive, whereas the impacts of exchange rates are negative. The roles of the CPI on credit risk clustering are ambiguous. Idiosyncratic factors are vital for predicting credit risk clustering. From a policy perspective, our results not only strengthen the results of previous research but also provide a possible approach to model and predict the extreme co-movement of credit risk in business groups with financial indicators.},

  abstract = {Feature-based time series representations have attracted substantial attention in a wide range of time series analysis methods. Recently, the use of time series features for forecast model averaging has been an emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to extract features from time series automatically becomes crucial in state-of-the-art time series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on time series imaging. We first transform time series into recurrence plots, from which local features can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted features are used for forecast model averaging. Our experiments show that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less human intervention and a more comprehensive view of the raw time series data, yields highly comparable performances with the best methods in the largest forecasting competition dataset (M4) and outperforms the top methods in the Tourism forecasting competition dataset.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates mortality inequality across U.S. states by modeling and forecasting mortality rates via a forecast reconciliation approach. Understanding the heterogeneity in state-level mortality experience is of fundamental importance, as it can assist decision making for policymakers, health authorities, as well as local communities who are seeking to reduce inequalities and disparities in life expectancy. A key challenge of multi-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures across sub-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the state-level forecasts are coherent with the nationallevel forecasts. We address these issues by first obtaining independent state-level forecasts based on classical stochastic mortality models, and then incorporating the dependence structure in the forecast reconciliation process. Both traditional bottom-up reconciliation and the cutting-edge trace minimization reconciliation methods are considered. Based on the U.S. total mortality data for the period 1969–2017, we project the 10-year-ahead mortality rates at both national-level and state-level up to 2027. We find that the geographical inequality in the longevity levels is likely to continue in the future, and the mortality improvement rates will tend to slow down in the coming decades.},

Our framework estimates weights in the forecast combination via Bayesian log predictive scores, in which the optimal forecasting combination is determined by time series features from historical information. In particular, we use an automatic Bayesian variable selection method to add weight to the importance of different features. To this end, our approach has better interpretability compared to other black-box forecasting combination schemes. We apply our framework to stock market data and M3 competition data. Based on our structure, a simple maximum-a-posteriori scheme outperforms benchmark methods, and Bayesian variable selection can further enhance the accuracy for both point and density forecasts.},

In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing forecasting approaches for intermittent demand from academic and practical perspectives. However, limited attention has been given to forecast combination methods, which have achieved competitive performance in forecasting fast-moving time series. The current study aims to examine the empirical outcomes of some existing forecast combination methods and propose a generalized feature-based framework for intermittent demand forecasting. The proposed framework has been shown to improve the accuracy of point and quantile forecasts based on two real data sets. Further, some analysis of features, forecasting pools and computational efficiency is also provided. The findings indicate the intelligibility and flexibility of the proposed approach in intermittent demand forecasting and offer insights regarding inventory decisions.},

  abstract = {The recent global financial crisis demonstrates that market liquidity is a prominent systematic risk globally. We find that local liquidity risk, in addition to the local market, value and size factors, demands a systematic premium across stocks in 11 developed markets. This local pricing premium is smaller in countries where the country-level corporate boards are more effective and where there are less insider trading activities. We also discover that global liquidity risk is a significant pricing factor across all developed country market portfolios after controlling for global market, value, and size factors. The contribution of this risk to the return on a country market portfolio is economically and statistically significant within and across regions.},

The newly defined RWS lays the foundation of online updating likelihood, online updating loss function, online updating estimating equation and so on. The idea of RWS is intuitive and heuristic, and the algorithm is computationally simple. This paper chooses nonparametric model as an exemplary setting. The RWS applies to various types of nonparametric estimators, which include but are not limited to nonparametric likelihood, quasilikelihood and least squares. Furthermore, the method and the theory can be extended into the models with both parameter and nonparametric function. The estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed renewable estimator are established, and the oracle property is obtained. Moreover, these properties are always satisfied, without any constraint on the number of data batches, which means that the new method is adaptive to the situation where streaming data sets arrive perpetually. The behavior of the method is further illustrated by various numerical examples from simulation experiments and real data analysis.},

  abstract = {Assigning weights to a large pool of objects is a fundamental task in a wide variety of applications. In this article, we introduce the concept of structured high-dimensional probability simplexes, in which most components are zero or near zero and the remaining ones are close to each other. Such structure is well motivated by (i) high-dimensional weights that are common in modern applications, and (ii) ubiquitous examples in which equal weights---despite their simplicity---often achieve favorable or even state-of-the-art predictive performance. This particular structure, however, presents unique challenges partly because, unlike high-dimensional linear regression, the parameter space is a simplex and pattern switching between partial constancy and sparsity is unknown. To address these challenges, we propose a new class of double spike Dirichlet priors to shrink a probability simplex to one with the desired structure. When applied to ensemble learning, such priors lead to a Bayesian method for structured high-dimensional ensembles that is useful for forecast combination and improving random forests, while enabling uncertainty quantification. We design efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for implementation. Posterior contraction rates are established to study large sample behaviors of the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the wide applicability and competitive performance of the proposed methods through simulations and two real data applications using the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters data set and a data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI).},

This class of algorithms adopts a divide-and-conquer approach based upon an auxiliary tree-structured decomposition of the model of interest, turning the overall inferential task into a collection of recursively solved subproblems. The proposed method is applicable to a broad class of probabilistic graphical models, including models with loops. Unlike a standard SMC sampler, the proposed divideand-conquer SMC employs multiple independent populations of weighted particles, which are resampled, merged, and propagated as the method progresses. We illustrate empirically that this approach can outperform standard methods in terms of the accuracy of the posterior expectation and marginal likelihood approximations. Divide-and-conquer SMC also opens up novel parallel implementation options and the possibility of concentrating the computational effort on the most challenging subproblems. We demonstrate its performance on a Markov random field and on a hierarchical logistic regression problem. Supplementary materials including proofs and additional numerical results are available online.},

  abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

As a result of these properties, we show that, anomalies are susceptible to a mechanism called               isolation               . This article proposes a method called Isolation Forest (               i               Forest), which detects anomalies purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measure---fundamentally different from all existing methods.                                         As a result,               i               Forest is able to exploit subsampling (i) to achieve a low linear time-complexity and a small memory-requirement and (ii) to deal with the effects of swamping and masking effectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that               i               Forest outperforms ORCA, one-class SVM, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC, processing time, and it is robust against masking and swamping effects.               i               Forest also works well in high dimensional problems containing a large number of irrelevant attributes, and when anomalies are not available in training sample.},

Our hybrid model thus overcomes a long‐standing empirical difficulty that default correlation estimation relies on the unobservable asset process. The empirical analysis shows that our hybrid model demonstrates a considerable improvement over the existing structural model of Zhou (2001) for the sample periods of 19701993 and 1990‐2010. We also illustrate the difference between the two models in predicting default correlations over the period of the 2008 financial crisis.},

However, when this conditional distribution is non-stationary, it poses challenges for these models to learn consistently and to predict accurately. In this work, we propose a new method to model non-stationary conditional distributions over time by clearly decoupling stationary conditional distribution modeling from non-stationary dynamics modeling. Our method is based on a Bayesian dynamic model that can adapt to conditional distribution changes and a deep conditional distribution model that can handle large multivariate time series using a factorized output space. Our experimental results on synthetic and popular public datasets show that our model can adapt to non-stationary time series better than state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.},

The method is based on a variational approximation to a tractable augmented posterior and is faster than previous likelihood-based approaches. We use it to estimate drawable vine copulas for univariate and multivariate Markov ordinal and mixed time series. These have dimension rT, where T is the number of observations and r is the number of series, and are difficult to estimate using previous methods. The vine pair-copulas are carefully selected to allow for heteroscedasticity, which is a feature of most ordinal time series data. When combined with flexible margins, the resulting time series models also allow for other common features of ordinal data, such as zero inflation, multiple modes, and under or overdispersion. Using six example series, we illustrate both the flexibility of the time series copula models and the efficacy of the VB estimator for copulas of up to 792 dimensions and 60 parameters. This far exceeds the size and complexity of copula models for discrete data that can be estimated using previous methods. An online appendix and MATLAB code implementing the method are available as supplementary materials.},

In multivariate time series, this can be achieved with a copula model, where both serial and crosssectional dependence is captured by a copula function, and the margins are nonparametric. Yet most existing copulas cannot capture heteroscedasticity well, which is a feature of many economic and financial time series. To do so, we propose a new copula created by the inversion of a multivariate unobserved component stochastic volatility model, and show how to estimate it using Bayesian methods. We fit the copula model to real-time data on five quarterly U.S. economic and financial variables. The copula model captures heteroscedasticity, dependence in the level, time-variation in higher moments, bounds on variables and other features. Over the window 1975Q1-2016Q2, the real-time density forecasts of all the macroeconomic variables exhibit time-varying asymmetry. In particular, forecasts of GDP growth have increased negative skew during recessions. The point and density forecasts from the copula model are competitive with those from benchmark models-particularly for inflation, a short-term interest rate and current quarter GDP growth. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Most genotype estimates are very accurate, but genotyping errors do occur and can influence test statistics, p-values and ranks. Some SNPs are harder to call than others due to probe properties and other technical/biological factors; uncertainties can be associated with features of interest. SNP- and case- specific genotype posterior probabilities are available, but they are typically not used or used only informally, for example by setting aside the most uncertain calls. To improve on these approaches we take full advantage of Bayesian structuring and develop an analytic framework that accommodates genotype uncertainties in case-control studies. We show that the power of a score test (and statistical information more generally) is directly a function of the correlation of the genotype probabilities with the true genotypes. We demonstrate that compared to picking a single AA, AB or BB genotype or to setting aside difficult calls, Bayesian structuring can substantially increase statistical information for detecting a true association and for ranking SNPs whether the ranking be frequentist or optimal Bayes.},

We apply the framework to euro area sovereign CDS spreads from 2008 to mid-2011. Our results reveal significant time-variation in distress dependence and considerable spill-over effects in the likelihood of sovereign default. We also investigate distress dependence around a policy announcement on May 9, 2010, and demonstrate the importance of capturing higher-order time-varying moments during times of crisis for the correct assessment of interacting risks.},

  abstract = {Distributed data naturally arise in scenarios involving multiple sources of observations, each stored at a different location. Directly pooling all the data together is often prohibited due to limited bandwidth and storage, or due to privacy protocols. A new robust distributed algorithm is introduced for fitting linear regressions when data are subject to heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric errors with finite second moments. The algorithm only communicates gradient information at each iteration, and therefore is communication-efficient. To achieve the bias-robustness tradeoff, the key is a novel double-robustification approach that applies on both the local and global objective functions. Statistically, the resulting estimator achieves the centralized nonasymptotic error bound as if all the data were pooled together and came from a distribution with sub-Gaussian tails. Under a finite (2+δ)-th moment condition, a Berry-Esseen bound for the distributed estimator is established, based on which robust confidence intervals are constructed. In high dimensions, the proposed doubly-robustified loss function is complemented with ℓ1-penalization for fitting sparse linear models with distributed data. Numerical studies further confirm that compared with extant distributed methods, the proposed methods achieve near-optimal accuracy with low variability and better coverage with tighter confidence width.},

Parallel training data is typically required for the training of singing voice conversion system, that is however not practical in real-life applications. Recent encoder-decoder structures, such as variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN), provide an effective way to learn a mapping through non-parallel training data. In this paper, we propose a singing voice conversion framework that is based on VAW-GAN. We train an encoder to disentangle singer identity and singing prosody (F0 contour) from phonetic content. By conditioning on singer identity and F0, the decoder generates output spectral features with unseen target singer identity, and improves F0 rendering. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better performance than the baseline frameworks.},

  abstract = {Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is nontrivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers—including stochastic gradient versions—based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework. We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially “reinvented” in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC). Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.},

In fact, time series forecasting is transformed into fully images- and signal-based processing procedures. After transforming a time series data into its corresponding image, the problem of data forecasting becomes essentially a problem of image inpainting problem, i.e., completing missing data in the image. An extensive experimental evaluation is conducted using a large dataset proposed by the well-known M3-competition. Results show that FM2I represents an efficient and robust tool for time series forecasting. It has achieved prominent results in terms of accuracy and outperforms the best M3 forecasting methods.},

  abstract = {Topic models, and more specifically the class of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are widely used for probabilistic modeling of text. MCMC sampling from the posterior distribution is typically performed using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We propose a parallel sparse partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and compare its speed and efficiency to state-of-the-art samplers for topic models on five well-known text corpora of differing sizes and properties. In particular, we propose and compare two different strategies for sampling the parameter block with latent topic indicators. The experiments show that the increase in statistical inefficiency from only partial collapsing is smaller than commonly assumed, and can be more than compensated by the speedup from parallelization and sparsity on larger corpora. We also prove that the partially collapsed samplers scale well with the size of the corpus. The proposed algorithm is fast, efficient, exact, and can be used in more modeling situations than the ordinary collapsed sampler.},

  abstract = {In deterministic optimization, line searches are a standard tool ensuring stability and efficiency. Where only stochastic gradients are available, no direct equivalent has so far been formulated, because uncertain gradients do not allow for a strict sequence of decisions collapsing the search space. We construct a probabilistic line search by combining the structure of existing deterministic methods with notions from Bayesian optimization. Our method retains a Gaussian process surrogate of the univariate optimization objective, and uses a probabilistic belief over the Wolfe conditions to monitor the descent. The algorithm has very low computational cost, and no user-controlled parameters. Experiments show that it effectively removes the need to define a learning rate for stochastic gradient descent.},

They provide useful, objective information to improve the theory and practice of forecasting, advancing the field, expanding its usage and enhancing its value to decision and policymakers. We describe ten design attributes to be considered when organizing forecasting competitions, taking into account trade-offs between optimal choices and practical concerns like costs, as well as the time and effort required to participate in them. Consequently, we map all major past competitions in respect to their design attributes, identifying similarities and differences between them, as well as design gaps, and making suggestions about the principles to be included in future competitions, putting a particular emphasis on learning as much as possible from their implementation in order to help improve forecasting accuracy and uncertainty. We discuss that the task of forecasting often presents a multitude of challenges that can be difficult to be captured in a single forecasting contest. To assess the quality of a forecaster, we, therefore, propose that organizers of future competitions consider a multi-contest approach. We suggest the idea of a forecasting pentathlon, where different challenges of varying characteristics take place.},

M5 focused on a retail sales forecasting application with the objective to produce the most accurate point forecasts for 42,840 time series that represent the hierarchical unit sales of the largest retail company in the world, Walmart, as well as to provide the most accurate estimates of the uncertainty of these forecasts. Hence, the competition consisted of two parallel challenges, namely the Accuracy and Uncertainty forecasting competitions. M5 extended the results of the previous M competitions by: (a) significantly expanding the number of participating methods, especially those in the category of machine learning; (b) evaluating the performance of the uncertainty distribution along with point forecast accuracy; (c) including exogenous/explanatory variables in addition to the time series data; (d) using grouped, correlated time series; and (e) focusing on series that display intermittency. This paper describes the background, organization, and implementations of the competition, and it presents the data used and their characteristics. Consequently, it serves as introductory material to the results of the two forecasting challenges to facilitate their understanding.},

The competition required the submission of 30,490 point forecasts for the lowest cross-sectional aggregation level of the data, which could then be summed up accordingly to estimate forecasts for the remaining upward levels.

Given the nonlinear/non-Gaussian state-space form, approximating the likelihood for the parameters is conducted with output generated by the particle filter. Methods are employed to ensure that the approximating likelihood is continuous as a function of the unknown parameters thus enabling the use of Newton-Raphson type maximization algorithms. Our approach is robust and efficient relative to alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes employed in such contexts. The technique is applied to daily returns data for various stock price indices. We find strong evidence in favour of a leverage effect in all cases. Jumps are an important component in two out of the four series we consider.},

Specifically, we show how to adjust the tuning parameters of constant SGD to best match the stationary distribution to a posterior, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these two distributions. (2) We demonstrate that constant SGD gives rise to a new variational EM algorithm that optimizes hyperparameters in complex probabilistic models. (3) We also show how to tune SGD with momentum for approximate sampling. (4) We analyze stochastic-gradient MCMC algorithms. For Stochastic-Gradient Langevin Dynamics and Stochastic-Gradient Fisher Scoring, we quantify the approximation errors due to finite learning rates. Finally (5), we use the stochastic process perspective to give a short proof of why Polyak averaging is optimal. Based on this idea, we propose a scalable approximate MCMC algorithm, the Averaged Stochastic Gradient Sampler.},

By revealing information on a common fundamental factor and thereby affecting the behavior of creditors, the failure of a single firm can trigger the failure of another firm. The model provides a unique equilibrium framework to assess the consequences of contagion and yields some hitherto unnoticed insights. While contagion increases the correlation among the financial failures of different firms, its impact on the incidence of failure is ambiguous. I consider an analytically tractable version of the model in which the effect on the ex ante failure probabilities is exactly zero. Moreover, the impact of contagion increases with the relevance of a common underlying fundamental, but is limited to firms near the brink of success or failure.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem -- model, parameters, latent states -- is factored into the forecast distribution, with forecasts conditioned only on what is known or observed. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large, or complex. The current state of play in Bayesian forecasting is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide readers with an overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context. Whilst our primary focus is on applications in the fields of economics and finance, and their allied disciplines, sufficient general details about implementation are provided to aid and inform all investigators.},

  author = {Martin, Gael M and Frazier, David T and Robert, Christian P},
  pages = {47},
  abstract = {The Bayesian statistical paradigm uses the language of probability to express uncertainty about the phenomena that generate observed data. Probability distributions thus characterize Bayesian analysis, with the rules of probability used to transform prior probability distributions for all unknowns — parameters, latent variables, models — into posterior distributions, subsequent to the observation of data. Conducting Bayesian analysis requires the evaluation of integrals in which these probability distributions appear. Bayesian computation is all about evaluating such integrals in the typical case where no analytical solution exists. This paper takes the reader on a chronological tour of Bayesian computation over the past two and a half centuries. Beginning with the one-dimensional integral first confronted by Bayes in 1763, through to recent problems in which the unknowns number in the millions, we place all computational problems into a common framework, and describe all computational methods using a common notation. The aim is to help new researchers in particular — and more generally those interested in adopting a Bayesian approach to empirical work — make sense of the plethora of computational techniques that are now on offer; understand when and why different methods are useful; and see the links that do exist, between them all.},

The algorithm starts with the view that the stochasticity of the pseudo-samples generated by the simulator can be controlled externally by a vector of random numbers u, in such a way that the outcome, knowing u, is deterministic. For each instantiation of u we run an optimization procedure to minimize the distance between summary statistics of the simulator and the data. After reweighing these samples using the prior and the Jacobian (accounting for the change of volume in transforming from the space of summary statistics to the space of parameters) we show that this weighted ensemble represents a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution. The procedure can be run embarrassingly parallel (each node handling one sample) and anytime (by allocating resources to the worst performing sample). The procedure is validated on six experiments.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is fundamental for various use cases in different domains such as energy systems and economics. Creating a forecasting model for a specific use case requires an iterative and complex design process. The typical design process includes five sections (1) data preprocessing, (2) feature engineering, (3) hyperparameter optimization, (4) forecasting method selection, and (5) forecast ensembling, which are commonly organized in a pipeline structure. One promising approach to handle the ever-growing demand for time series forecasts is automating this design process. The article, thus, reviews existing literature on automated time series forecasting pipelines and analyzes how the design process of forecasting models is currently automated. Thereby, we consider both automated machine learning (AutoML) and automated statistical forecasting methods in a single forecasting pipeline. For this purpose, we first present and compare the identified automation methods for each pipeline section. Second, we analyze these automation methods regarding their interaction, combination, and coverage of the five pipeline sections. For both, we discuss the reviewed literature that contributes toward automating the design process, identify problems, give recommendations, and suggest future research. This review reveals that the majority of the reviewed literature only covers two or three of the five pipeline sections. We conclude that future research has to holistically consider the automation of the forecasting pipeline to enable the large-scale application of time series forecasting.

  abstract = {This paper studies high-dimensional vector autoregressions (VARs) augmented with common factors that allow for strong cross-sectional dependence. Models of this type provide a convenient mechanism for accommodating the interconnectedness and temporal co-variability that are often present in large dimensional systems. We propose an ℓ1-nuclear-norm regularized estimator and derive the non-asymptotic upper bounds for the estimation errors as well as large sample asymptotics for the estimates. A singular value thresholding procedure is used to determine the correct number of factors with probability approaching one. Both the LASSO estimator and the conservative LASSO estimator are employed to improve estimation precision. The conservative LASSO estimates of the non-zero coefficients are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle least squares estimates. Simulations demonstrate that our estimators perform reasonably well in finite samples given the complex high-dimensional nature of the model. In an empirical illustration we apply the methodology to explore dynamic connectedness in the volatilities of financial asset prices and the transmission of ‘investor fear’. The findings reveal that a large proportion of connectedness is due to the common factors. Conditional on the presence of these common factors, the results still document remarkable connectedness due to the interactions between the individual variables, thereby supporting a common factor augmented VAR specification.},

They have been successfully applied in the medical domain where symmetries in the data can be effectively exploited to build more accurate and robust models. To be able to reach a much larger body of patients, mobile, on-device implementations of deep learning solutions have been developed for medical applications. However, equivariant models are commonly implemented using large and computationally expensive architectures, not suitable to run on mobile devices. In this work, we design and test an equivariant version of MobileNetV2 and further optimize it with model quantization to enable more efficient inference. We achieve close-to state of the art performance on the Patch Camelyon (PCam) medical dataset while being more computationally efficient.},

We provide the following contributions that help understand the potential and applicability of global methods and how they relate to traditional local methods that fit a separate forecasting method to each series: •Global and local methods can produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the series in the set.•The complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains constant for global methods. This result supports the recent evidence and provides principles for the design of new algorithms.•In an extensive empirical study, we show that purposely naïve algorithms derived from these principles show outstanding accuracy. In particular, global linear models provide competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters than the simplest of local methods.},

  abstract = {Time series data are a collection of chronological observations which are generated by several domains such as medical and financial fields. Over the years, different tasks such as classification, forecasting and clustering have been proposed to analyze this type of data. Time series data have been also used to study the effect of interventions overtime. Moreover, in many fields of science, learning the causal structure of dynamic systems and time series data is considered an interesting task which plays an important role in scientific discoveries. Estimating the effect of an intervention and identifying the causal relations from the data can be performed via causal inference. Existing surveys on time series discuss traditional tasks such as classification and forecasting or explain the details of the approaches proposed to solve a specific task. In this paper, we focus on two causal inference tasks, i.e., treatment effect estimation and causal discovery for time series data and provide a comprehensive review of the approaches in each task. Furthermore, we curate a list of commonly used evaluation metrics and datasets for each task and provide an in-depth insight. These metrics and datasets can serve as benchmark for research in the field.},

Our approach first constructs a prior chosen to be vague in a suitable sense, and updates this prior to obtain a sequence of posteriors corresponding to each of a range of sample sizes. We then compute a distance between each posterior and the parametric prior, defined in terms of the curvature of the logarithm of each distribution, and the posterior minimizing the distance defines the effective sample size of the prior. For cases where the distance cannot be computed analytically, we provide a numerical approximation based on Monte Carlo simulation. We provide general guidelines for application, illustrate the method in several standard cases where the answer seems obvious, and then apply it to some nonstandard settings.},

  abstract = {Passenger Name Records (PNRs) are at the heart of the travel industry. Created when an itinerary is booked, they contain travel and passenger information. It is usual for airlines and other actors in the industry to inter-exchange and access each other’s PNR, creating the challenge of using them without infringing data ownership laws. To address this difficulty, we propose a method to generate realistic synthetic PNRs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN applications, PNRs consist of categorical and numerical features with missing/NaN values, which makes the use of GANs challenging. We propose a solution based on Crame´r GANs, categorical feature embedding and a Cross-Net architecture. The method was tested on a real PNR dataset, and evaluated in terms of distribution matching, memorization, and performance of predictive models for two real business problems: client segmentation and passenger nationality prediction. Results show that the generated data matches well with the real PNRs without memorizing them, and that it can be used to train models for real business applications.},

The higher-order dynamics allow for more flexible discretization schemes, and we develop a specific method that combines splitting with more accurate integration. For a broad class of \$d\$-dimensional distributions arising from generalized linear models, we prove that the resulting third-order algorithm produces samples from a distribution that is at most \$\textbackslash varepsilon {$>$} 0\$ in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution in \$O\textbackslash left(\textbackslash frac\{d\^\{1/4\}\}\{ \textbackslash varepsilon\^\{1/2\}\} \textbackslash right)\$ steps. This result requires only Lipschitz conditions on the gradient. For general strongly convex potentials with \$\textbackslash alpha\$-th order smoothness, we prove that the mixing time scales as \$O \textbackslash left(\textbackslash frac\{d\^\{1/4\}\}\{\textbackslash varepsilon\^\{1/2\}\} + \textbackslash frac\{d\^\{1/2\}\}\{\textbackslash varepsilon\^\{1/(\textbackslash alpha - 1)\}\} \textbackslash right)\$.},

In contrast, vine copula models accommodate more elaborate features like tail dependence and asymmetry, as well as independent modeling of the marginals. This flexibility comes however at the cost of exponentially increasing complexity for model selection and estimation. We show a novel connection between DAGs with limited number of parents and truncated vine copulas under sufficient conditions. This motivates a more general procedure exploiting the fast model selection and estimation of sparse DAGs while allowing for non-Gaussian dependence using vine copulas. By numerical examples in hundreds of dimensions, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the standard method for vine structure selection.

  abstract = {To model high dimensional data, Gaussian methods are widely used since they remain tractable and yield parsimonious models by imposing strong assumptions on the data. Vine copulas are more flexible by combining arbitrary marginal distributions and (conditional) bivariate copulas. Yet, this adaptability is accompanied by sharply increasing computational effort as the dimension increases. The proposed approach overcomes this burden and makes the first step into ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence modeling by using a divide-and-conquer approach. First, Gaussian methods are applied to split datasets into feasibly small subsets and second, parsimonious and flexible vine copulas are applied thereon. Finally, these sub-models are reconciled into one joint model. Numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of the novel approach in moderate dimensions are provided. The ability of the approach to estimate ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence models in thousands of dimensions is presented.},

  abstract = {Randomized clinical trials have been the mainstay of clinical research, but are prohibitively expensive and subject to increasingly difficult patient recruitment. Recently, there is a movement to use real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records, patient registries, claims data and other sources in lieu of or supplementing controlled clinical trials. This process of combining information from diverse sources calls for inference under a Bayesian paradigm. We review some of the currently used methods and a novel non-parametric Bayesian (BNP) method. Carrying out the desired adjustment for differences in patient populations is naturally done with BNP priors that facilitate understanding of and adjustment for population heterogeneities across different data sources. We discuss the particular problem of using RWD to create a synthetic control arm to supplement single-arm treatment only studies. At the core of the proposed approach is the model-based adjustment to achieve equivalent patient populations in the current study and the (adjusted) RWD. This is implemented using common atoms mixture models. The structure of such models greatly simplifies inference. The adjustment for differences in the populations can be reduced to ratios of weights in such mixtures.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Gaussian factor models have proven widely useful for parsimoniously characterizing dependence in multivariate data. There is a rich literature on their extension to mixed categorical and continuous variables, using latent Gaussian variables or through generalized latent trait models acommodating measurements in the exponential family. However, when generalizing to non-Gaussian measured variables the latent variables typically influence both the dependence structure and the form of the marginal distributions, complicating interpretation and introducing artifacts. To address this problem we propose a novel class of Bayesian Gaussian copula factor models which decouple the latent factors from the marginal distributions. A semiparametric specification for the marginals based on the extended rank likelihood yields straightforward implementation and substantial computational gains. We provide new theoretical and empirical justifications for using this likelihood in Bayesian inference. We propose new default priors for the factor loadings and develop efficient parameter-expanded Gibbs sampling for posterior computation. The methods are evaluated through simulations and applied to a dataset in political science. The models in this paper are implemented in the R package bfa.1 Jared S.

To avoid large matrix computations needed in a standard Gibbs sampler, we propose a novel Gibbs sampler called “Skinny Gibbs” which is much more scalable to high-dimensional problems, both in memory and in computational efficiency. In particular, its computational complexity grows only linearly in p, the number of predictors, while retaining the property of strong model selection consistency even when p is much greater than the sample size n. The present article focuses on logistic regression due to its broad applicability as a representative member of the generalized linear models. We compare our proposed method with several leading variable selection methods through a simulation study to show that Skinny Gibbs has a strong performance as indicated by our theoretical work.

  abstract = {Much of the existing literature on default contagion assumes a direct causal relationships between two obligors’ defaults. In this paper we present a model in which default contagion arises without causal links solely from information effects if investors are imperfectly informed about some common factors affecting the true riskiness of the obligors. We model this effect in a simple extension of the intensity-based modelling framework using unobserved frailty variables. If one obligor defaults in this model, the default intensities of other obligors exhibit jumps which are proportional to the covariances of the corresponding frailties. This allows the modelling of much higher (and more realistic) levels of default dependence between the obligors than what purely diffusion-based intensity models were able to capture previously, without adding too much additional complexity. The parameters of the dependence can be implied directly from spread jumps observed in the market, thus enabling a full specification of the model under pricing probabilities without recourse to historical default correlations. We furthermore present an extension of the model in which the size of the contagion effect can depend on the reason for the default and not just the identity of the defaulted obligor, thus introducing stochastic dependency.},

Almost all previous analysis has focused upon continuous target densities. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimensionality d of the target densities converges to infinity. In particular, when the proposal variance is scaled by \$d\^\{-2\}\$, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to an appropriate Langevin diffusion process. Therefore optimizing the efficiency of the RWM algorithm is equivalent to maximizing the speed of the limiting diffusion. This leads to an asymptotic optimal acceptance rate of \$e\^\{-2\}\$ (=0.1353) under quite general conditions. The results have major practical implications for the implementation of RWM algorithms by highlighting the detrimental effect of choosing RWM algorithms over Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithms.},

  abstract = {I show how it can be beneficial to express Metropolis accept/reject decisions in terms of comparison with a uniform [0, 1] value, and to then update this uniform value non-reversibly, as part of the Markov chain state, rather than sampling it independently each iteration. This provides a small improvement for random walk Metropolis and Langevin updates in high dimensions. It produces a larger improvement when using Langevin updates with persistent momentum, giving performance comparable to that of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with long trajectories. This is of significance when some variables are updated by other methods, since if HMC is used, these updates can be done only between trajectories, whereas they can be done more often with Langevin updates.

  abstract = {Communication costs, resulting from synchronization requirements during learning, can greatly slow down many parallel machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which subsets of data are processed independently, with very little communication. First, we arbitrarily partition data onto multiple machines. Then, on each machine, any classical MCMC method (e.g., Gibbs sampling) may be used to draw samples from a posterior distribution given the data subset. Finally, the samples from each machine are combined to form samples from the full posterior. This embarrassingly parallel algorithm allows each machine to act independently on a subset of the data (without communication) until the final combination stage. We prove that our algorithm generates asymptotically exact samples and empirically demonstrate its ability to parallelize burn-in and sampling in several models.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are generally regarded as the gold standard technique for Bayesian inference. They are theoretically well-understood and conceptually simple to apply in practice. The drawback of MCMC is that in general performing exact inference requires all of the data to be processed at each iteration of the algorithm. For large data sets, the computational cost of MCMC can be prohibitive, which has led to recent developments in scalable Monte Carlo algorithms that have a significantly lower computational cost than standard MCMC. In this paper, we focus on a particular class of scalable Monte Carlo algorithms, stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) which utilises data subsampling techniques to reduce the per-iteration cost of MCMC. We provide an introduction to some popular SGMCMC algorithms and review the supporting theoretical results, as well as comparing the efficiency of SGMCMC algorithms against MCMC on benchmark examples. The supporting R code is available online1.},

In this paper, we consider an alternative transformation of an arbitrary random variable to a uniformly distributed one. Using this technique, the class of all possible copulas in the general case is investigated. In particular, we show that one of its members—the standard extension copula introduced by Schweizer and Sklar—captures the dependence structures in an analogous way the unique copula does in the continuous case. Furthermore, we consider measures of concordance between arbitrary random variables and obtain generalizations of Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho that correspond to the sample version of these quantities for empirical distributions.},

Exploring the analogy to a lattice gas model from physics, correlations between sequential defaults are modeled as due to functionally defined, heterogeneous couplings between mutually dependent counterparties. We show that—already for moderate micro-economic dependencies—counterparty risk results in a fattening of the tails in the portfolio loss distribution. In particular, for stronger mutually supportive relationship between the firms, collective phenomena such as bursts and avalanches of defaults can be observed in the model. In this context, traditional credit risk models are inadequate because they underestimate the required capital buffer. Our model setting is particularly applicable for doing stress analyses of credit risk in loan portfolios.},

We propose a general construction of a functional mapping from the covariate space to the cone of sparse positive definite matrices, which encompasses many existing graphical models for heterogeneous settings. Our methodology is based on a novel mixture prior for precision matrices with a non-local component that admits attractive theoretical and empirical properties. The flexible formulation of GGMx allows both the strength and the sparsity pattern of the precision matrix (hence the graph structure) change with the covariates. Posterior inference is carried out with a carefully designed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which ensures the positive definiteness of sparse precision matrices at any given covariates' values. Extensive simulations and a case study in cancer genomics demonstrate the utility of the proposed model.},

We focus on situations when the parameter of interest has been emancipated from the likelihood and is linked to data directly through a loss function. We survey existing work on both Bayesian parametric inference with Gibbs posteriors and Bayesian non-parametric inference. We then highlight recent bootstrap computational approaches to approximating loss-driven posteriors. In particular, we focus on implicit bootstrap distributions defined through an underlying push-forward mapping. We investigate independent, identically distributed (iid) samplers from approximate posteriors that pass random bootstrap weights through a trained generative network. After training the deep-learning mapping, the simulation cost of such iid samplers is negligible. We compare the performance of these deep bootstrap samplers with exact bootstrap as well as MCMC on several examples (including support vector machines or quantile regression). We also provide theoretical insights into bootstrap posteriors by drawing upon connections to model mis-specification.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {Operational Research (OR) is the ‘science of better’. People constantly try to get better, in practically all aspects of their personal and professional life, and thus OR is de facto a ubiquitous science. What might however not be that clear, is that the way we improve is driven by the very OR science, and the scientific results that constitute the respective body of literature, theory and practice. Of all the tasks, that can be related to the OR science, the one that more frequently we do, is forecasting. We do constantly try to estimate what is coming next, and we drive our decisions for each and every situation based on these forecasts: from where to put our money to who will be the best surgeon to operate us. Within the broad boundaries of OR, forecasting stands out as the most ubiquitous sub-discipline. In the forecasting literature, a lot of attention has been given to modeling fast-moving time series and building causal models; however, very limited attention has been given to intermittent time series and intermittent demand forecasting. In this research, we advocate for the broader use of intermittent demand forecasting methods for forecasting special events, as a simpler, faster, and robust alternative to more complex non-OR models. Furthermore, in a foresight context, we argue for a novel way of deciding the strategic planning horizon for phenomena prone to appearance of special events.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful sampling algorithm employed by several probabilistic programming languages. Its fully automatic implementations have made HMC a standard tool for applied Bayesian modeling. While its performance is often superior to alternatives under a wide range of models, one prominent weakness of HMC is its inability to handle discrete parameters. In this article, we present discontinuous HMC, an extension that can efficiently explore discrete spaces involving ordinal parameters as well as target distributions with discontinuous densities. The proposed algorithm is based on two key ideas: embedding of discrete parameters into a continuous space and simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics on a piecewise smooth density function. When properly-tuned, discontinuous HMC is guaranteed to outperform a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm as the two algorithms coincide under a specific (and sub-optimal) implementation of discontinuous HMC. It is additionally shown that the dynamics underlying discontinuous HMC have a remarkable similarity to a zig-zag process, a continuous-time Markov process behind a state-of-the-art non-reversible rejection-free sampler. We apply our algorithm to challenging posterior inference problems to demonstrate its wide applicability and competitive performance.},

The model is a finite mixture of normal distributions with covariate dependent multinomial logit mixing probabilities. A prior for the number of mixture components is specified on positive integers. The marginal distribution of covariates is not modeled. We study asymptotic frequentist behavior of the posterior in this model. Specifically, we show that when the true conditional density has a certain smoothness level, then the posterior contraction rate around the truth is equal up to a log factor to the frequentist minimax rate of estimation. An extension to the case when the covariate space is unbounded is also established. As our result holds without a priori knowledge of the smoothness level of the true density, the established posterior contraction rates are adaptive. Moreover, we show that the rate is not affected by inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. In Monte Carlo simulations, a version of the model compares favorably to a cross-validated kernel conditional density estimator.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback–Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.},

After creditors observe what occurs in a rollover game for a firm, they conjecture one another’s ‘‘type’’ or attitude toward the risk associated with the firm’s investment project. Creditors’ inference about one another’s type then influences their decision to lend to the next firm. By providing an analysis of the ‘‘incidence of failure’’ (the threshold for a liquidity crisis) for each firm, this paper demonstrates that the risk of contagion increases sharply if it originates ex ante from a firm facing a low probability of failure. In addition, the paper proposes some policy measures for mitigating the severity of contagion during a liquidity crisis.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting problems arise when time series have a natural group structure, and predictions at multiple levels of aggregation and disaggregation across the groups are needed. In such problems, it is often desired to satisfy the aggregation constraints in a given hierarchy, referred to as hierarchical coherence in the literature. Maintaining hierarchical coherence while producing accurate forecasts can be a challenging problem, especially in the case of probabilistic forecasting. We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for hierarchical time series. We call it Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN). It relies on the combination of neural networks and a statistical model for the joint distribution of the hierarchical multivariate time series structure. By construction, the model guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the predictive distributions. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other state-of-the-art methods which produce hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasts on multiple public datasets. Compared to existing coherent probabilistic models, we obtained a relative improvement in the overall Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 11.8\% on Australian domestic tourism data, and 8.1\% on the Favorita grocery sales dataset.},

  abstract = {One popular approach to likelihood-free inference is the synthetic likelihood method, which assumes that some data summary statistics which are informative about model parameters are approximately Gaussian for each value of the parameter. Based on this assumption, a Gaussian likelihood can be constructed, where the mean and covariance matrix of the summary statistics are estimated via Monte Carlo. The objective of the current work is to improve on a variational implementation of the Bayesian synthetic likelihood introduced recently in the literature, to enable the application of that approach to high-dimensional problems. Here high-dimensional can mean problems with more than one hundred parameters. The improvements introduced relate to shrinkage estimation of covariance matrices in estimation of the synthetic likelihood, improved implementation of control variate approaches to stochastic gradient variance reduction, and parsimonious but expressive parametrizations of variational normal posterior covariance matrices in terms of factor structures to reduce the dimension of the optimization problem. The shrinkage covariance estimation is particularly important for stability of stochastic gradient optimization with noisy likelihood estimates. However, as the dimension increases, the quality of the posterior approximation deteriorates unless the number of Monte Carlo samples used to estimate the synthetic likelihood also increases. We explore the properties of the method in some real examples in cases where either the number of summary statistics, the number of model parameters, or both, are large.},

  abstract = {We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11\% over a statistical benchmark and by 3\% over last year’s winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.},

There are several approaches for the estimation of VaR, such as historical simulation, the variance-covariance (also known as analytical), and the Monte Carlo approaches. Whereas the first approach does not assume any distribution, the last two approaches demand the joint distribution to be known, which in the analytical approach is frequently the normal distribution. The copula theory is a fundamental tool in modeling multivariate distributions. It allows the definition of the joint distribution through the marginal distributions and the dependence between the variables. Recently the copula theory has been extended to the conditional case, allowing the use of copulae to model dynamical structures. Time variation in the first and second conditional moments is widely discussed in the literature, so allowing the time variation in the conditional dependence seems to be natural. This work presents some concepts and properties of copula functions and an application of the copula theory in the estimation of VaR of a portfolio composed by Nasdaq and S\&P500 stock indices.},

  abstract = {Quantile regression is a method of fundamental importance. How to efficiently conduct quantile regression for a large dataset on a distributed system is of great importance. We show that the popularly used one-shot estimation is statistically inefficient if data are not randomly distributed across different workers. To fix the problem, a novel one-step estimation method is developed with the following nice properties. First, the algorithm is communication efficient. That is the communication cost demanded is practically acceptable. Second, the resulting estimator is statistically efficient. That is its asymptotic covariance is the same as that of the global estimator. Third, the estimator is robust against data distribution. That is its consistency is guaranteed even if data are not randomly distributed across different workers. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our findings. A real example is also presented for illustration.},

  abstract = {Electricity spot prices exhibit strong time series properties, including substantial periodicity, both inter-day and intraday serial correlation, heavy tails and skewness. In this paper we capture these characteristics using a first order vector autoregressive model with exogenous effects and a skew t distributed disturbance. The vector is longitudinal, in that it comprises observations on the spot price at intervals during a day. A band two inverse scale matrix is employed for the disturbance, as well as a sparse autoregressive coefficient matrix. This corresponds to a parsimonious dependency structure that directly relates an observation to the two immediately prior, and the observation at the same time the previous day. We estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which allows for the evaluation of the complete predictive distribution of future spot prices. We apply the model to hourly Australian electricity spot prices observed over a three year period, with four different nested multivariate error distributions: skew t, symmetric t, skew normal and symmetric normal. The forecasting performance is judged over a 30 day forecast trial using the continuous ranked probability score, which accounts for both predictive bias and sharpness.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose an approach to both estimate and select unknown smooth functions in an additive model with potentially many functions. Each function is written as a linear combination of basis terms, with coefficients regularized by a proper linearly constrained Gaussian prior. Given any potentially rank deficient prior precision matrix, we show how to derive linear constraints so that the corresponding effect is identified in the additive model. This allows for the use of a wide range of bases and precision matrices in priors for regularization. By introducing indicator variables, each constrained Gaussian prior is augmented with a point mass at zero, thus allowing for function selection. Posterior inference is calculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo and the smoothness in the functions is both the result of shrinkage through the constrained Gaussian prior and model averaging. We show how using non-degenerate priors on the shrinkage parameters enables the application of substantially more computationally efficient sampling schemes than would otherwise be the case. We show the favourable performance of our approach when compared to two contemporary alternative Bayesian methods. To highlight the potential of our approach in high-dimensional settings we apply it to estimate two large seemingly unrelated regression models for intra-day electricity load. Both models feature a variety of different univariate and bivariate functions which require different levels of smoothing, and where component selection is meaningful. Priors for the error disturbance covariances are selected carefully and the empirical results provide a substantive contribution to the electricity load modelling literature in their own right.},

We introduce binary indicators to denote whether there is symmetry, or skew, in each dimension. We adopt a proper beta prior on each non-zero skew coefficient, and derive the corresponding prior on the skew parameters. In both distributions we show that as the degrees of freedom increases, the prior smoothly bounds the non-zero skew parameters away from zero and identifies the posterior. We estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by exploiting the conditionally Gaussian representation of the skew t distributions. This allows for the search through the posterior space of all possible combinations of skew and symmetry in each dimension. We show that the proposed method works well in a simulation setting, and employ it in two multivariate econometric examples. The first involves the modeling of foreign exchange rates and the second is a vector autoregression for intra-day electricity spot prices. The approach selects skew along the original coordinates of the data, which proves insightful in both examples.},

To assess whether similar results hold for economies with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on 151 aggregate and disaggregate economic series as well as 185 international variables, is introduced. An extensive empirical study is carried out investigating forecasts at different horizons, using a variety of methods and with information sets containing an increasing number of predictors. In contrast to other countries the results show that it is difficult to forecast Australian key macroeconomic variables more accurately than some simple benchmarks. In line with other studies we also find that there is little to no improvement in forecast accuracy when the number of predictors is expanded beyond 20–40 variables and international factors do not seem to help.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for prediction of multivariate data that follow some known linear constraints, such as the example where some variables are aggregates of others. This is particularly common when forecasting time series (predicting the future), but also arises in other types of prediction. For point prediction, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby predictions are made for all series (so-called ‘base’ predictions) and subsequently adjusted to ensure coherence with the constraints. This paper extends reconciliation from the setting of point prediction to probabilistic prediction. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic prediction. In the elliptical case, it is proven that the true predictive distribution can be recovered from reconciliation even when the location and scale matrix of the base prediction are chosen arbitrarily. To find reconciliation weights, an objective function based on scoring rules is optimised. The energy and variogram scores are considered since the log score is improper in the context of comparing unreconciled to reconciled predictions, a result also proved in this paper. To account for the stochastic nature of the energy and variogram scores, optimisation is achieved using stochastic gradient descent. This method is shown to improve base predictions in simulation studies and in an empirical application, particularly when the base prediction models are severely misspecified. When misspecification is not too severe, extending popular reconciliation methods for point prediction can result in a similar performance to score optimisation via stochastic gradient descent. The methods described here are implemented in the ProbReco package for R.},

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently in the literature. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman’s random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the globalscale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the features (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods relating tensor predictors to scalar outcomes in a regression model generally vectorize the tensor predictor and estimate the coefficients of its entries employing some form of regularization, use summaries of the tensor covariate, or use a low dimensional approximation of the coefficient tensor. However, low rank approximations of the coefficient tensor can suffer if the true rank is not small. We propose a tensor regression framework which assumes a soft version of the parallel factors (PARAFAC) approximation. In contrast to classic PARAFAC, where each entry of the coefficient tensor is the sum of products of row-specific contributions across the tensor modes, the soft tensor regression (Softer) framework allows the row-specific contributions to vary around an overall mean. We follow a Bayesian approach to inference, and show that softening the PARAFAC increases model flexibility, leads to more precise predictions, improved estimation of coefficient tensors, and more accurate identification of important predictor entries, even for a low approximation rank. From a theoretical perspective, we show that the posterior distribution of the coefficient tensor based on Softer is weakly consistent irrespective of the true tensor or approximation rank. In the context of our motivating application, we adapt Softer to symmetric and semi-symmetric tensor predictors and analyze the relationship between brain network characteristics and human traits.},

  abstract = {Privacy is an important concern for our society where sharing data with partners or releasing data to the public is a frequent occurrence. Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.},

  abstract = {Testing automotive mechatronic systems partly uses the software-in-the-loop approach, where systematically covering inputs of the system-under-test remains a major challenge. In current practice, there are two major techniques of input stimulation. One approach is to craft input sequences which eases control and feedback of the test process but falls short of exposing the system to realistic scenarios. The other is to replay sequences recorded from field operations which accounts for reality but requires collecting a well-labeled dataset of sufficient capacity for widespread use, which is expensive. This work applies the well-known unsupervised learning framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn an unlabeled dataset of recorded in-vehicle signals and uses it for generation of synthetic input stimuli. Additionally, a metric-based linear interpolation algorithm is demonstrated, which guarantees that generated stimuli follow a customizable similarity relationship with specified references. This combination of techniques enables controlled generation of a rich range of meaningful and realistic input patterns, improving virtual test coverage and reducing the need for expensive field tests.},

  abstract = {Linear correlation is only an adequate means of describing the dependence between two random variables when they are jointly elliptically distributed. When the joint distribution of two or more variables is not elliptical the linear correlation coefficient becomes just one of many possible ways of summarising the dependence structure between the variables. In this paper we make use of a theorem due to Sklar (1959), which shows that an n-dimensional distribution function may be decomposed into its n marginal distributions, and a copula, which completely describes the dependence between the n variables. We verify that Sklar's theorem may be extended to conditional distributions, and apply it to the modelling of the time-varying joint distribution of the Deutsche mark - U.S. dollar and Yen - U.S. dollar exchange rate returns. We find evidence that the conditional dependence between these exchange rates is time-varying, and that it is asymmetric: dependence is greater during appreciations of the U.S. dollar against the mark and the yen than during depreciations of the U.S. dollar. We also find strong evidence of a structural break in the conditional copula following the introduction of the euro.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new univariate forecasting method. The method is based on the concept of modifying the local curvature of the time-series through a coefficient 'Theta' (the Greek letter u), that is applied directly to the second differences of the data. The resulting series that are created maintain the mean and the slope of the original data but not their curvatures. These new time series are named Theta-lines. Their primary qualitative characteristic is the improvement of the approximation of the long-term behavior of the data or the augmentation of the short-term features, depending on the value of the Theta coefficient. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into two or more different Theta-lines. These are extrapolated separately and the subsequent forecasts are combined. The simple combination of two Theta-lines, the Theta 5 0 (straight line) and Theta 5 2 (double local curves) was adopted in order to produce forecasts for the 3003 series of the M3 competition. The method performed well, particularly for monthly series and for microeconomic data.},

  abstract = {Forecasting as a scientific discipline has progressed a lot in the last 40years, with Nobel prizes being awarded for seminal work in the field, most notably to Engle, Granger and Kahneman. Despite these advances, even today we are unable to answer a very simple question, the one that is always the first tabled during discussions with practitioners: “what is the best method for my data?”. In essence, as there are horses for courses, there must also be forecasting methods that are more tailored to some types of data, and, therefore, enable practitioners to make informed method selection when facing new data. The current study attempts to shed light on this direction via identifying the main determinants of forecasting accuracy, through simulations and empirical investigations involving 14 popular forecasting methods (and combinations of them), seven time series features (seasonality, trend, cycle, randomness, number of observations, inter-demand interval and coefficient of variation) and one strategic decision (the forecasting horizon). Our main findings dictate that forecasting accuracy is influenced as follows: (a) for fast-moving data, cycle and randomness have the biggest (negative) effect and the longer the forecasting horizon, the more accuracy decreases; (b) for intermittent data, inter-demand interval has bigger (negative) impact than the coefficient of variation; and (c) for all types of data, increasing the length of a series has a small positive effect.},

  abstract = {In this paper we focus on forecasting for intermittent demand data. We propose a new aggregation framework for intermittent demand forecasting that performs aggregation over the demand volumes, in contrast to the standard framework that employs temporal (over time) aggregation. To achieve this we construct a transformed time series, the inverse intermittent demand series. The new algorithm is expected to work best on erratic and lumpy demand, as a result of the variance reduction of the non-zero demands. The improvement in forecasting performance is empirically demonstrated through an extensive evaluation in more than 8000 time series of two well-researched spare parts data sets from the automotive and defence sectors. Furthermore, a simulation is performed so as to provide a stock-control evaluation. The proposed framework could find popularity among practitioners given its suitability when dealing with clump sizes. As such it could be used in conjunction with existing popular forecasting methods for intermittent demand as an exception handling mechanism when certain types of demand are observed.},

In this paper, we propose a new way to statistical model selection and model combination that incorporates the base-rates of the candidate forecasting models, which are then revised so that the per-series information is taken into account. We examine two schemes that are based on the precision and sensitivity information from the contingency table of the base rates. We apply our approach on pools of exponential smoothing models and a large number of real time series and we show that our schemes work better than standard statistical benchmarks. We discuss the connection of our approach to other cross-learning approaches and offer insights regarding implications for theory and practice.},

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.},

There are, however, numerous contexts of considerable scientific interest in which the natural supports for the data under consideration are Riemannian manifolds like the unit circle, torus, sphere and their extensions. Typically, such data can be represented using one or more directions, and directional statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with their analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the many recent developments in the field since the publication of Mardia and Jupp (1999), still the most comprehensive text on directional statistics. Many of those developments have been stimulated by interesting applications in fields as diverse as astronomy, medicine, genetics, neurology, aeronautics, acoustics, image analysis, text mining, environmetrics, and machine learning. We begin by considering developments for the exploratory analysis of directional data before progressing to distributional models, general approaches to inference, hypothesis testing, regression, nonparametric curve estimation, methods for dimension reduction, classification and clustering, and the modelling of time series, spatial, and spatio-temporal data. We end with an overview of presently available software for analyzing directional data.},

This fact is illustrated with a special case of filtered 2SLSspecifically, the forward orthogonal deviations (FOD) transformation. If a restriction on the instruments is satisfied, GMM based on the FOD transformation (FOD-GMM) is identical to GMM based on the more popular first-difference (FD) transformation (FD-GMM). However, the FOD transformation provides significant reductions in computing time when the length of the time series (T) is not small. If the instruments condition is not met, the FD and FOD transformations lead to different GMM estimators. In this case, the computational advantage of the FOD transformation over the FD transformation is not as dramatic. On the other hand, in this case, Monte Carlo evidence provided in the paper indicates that FOD-GMM has better sampling properties-smaller absolute bias and standard deviations. Moreover, if T is not small, the FOD-GMM estimator has better sampling properties than the FD-GMM estimator even when the latter estimator is based on the optimal weighting matrix. Hence, when T is not small, FOD-GMM dominates FD-GMM in terms of both computational efficiency and sampling performance.},

  abstract = {In various applications, probabilistic forecasts are required to quantify the inherent uncertainty associated with the forecast. However, numerous modern forecasting methods are still designed to create deterministic forecasts. Transforming these deterministic forecasts into probabilistic forecasts is often challenging and based on numerous assumptions that may not hold in real-world situations. Therefore, the present article proposes a novel approach for creating probabilistic forecasts from arbitrary deterministic forecasts. In order to implement this approach, we use a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). More specifically, we apply a cINN to learn the underlying distribution of the data and then combine the uncertainty from this distribution with an arbitrary deterministic forecast to generate accurate probabilistic forecasts. Our approach enables the simple creation of probabilistic forecasts without complicated statistical loss functions or further assumptions. Besides showing the mathematical validity of our approach, we empirically show that our approach noticeably outperforms traditional methods for including uncertainty in deterministic forecasts and generally outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Purpose Globally, the age-standardised prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has nearly doubled from 1980 to 2014, rising from 4.7\% to 8.5\% with an estimated 422 million adults living with the chronic disease. The MULTI sTUdy Diabetes rEsearch (MULTITUDE) consortium was recently established to harmonise data from 17 independent cohort studies and clinical trials and to facilitate a better understanding of the determinants, risk factors and outcomes associated with T2DM. Participants Participants range in age from 3 to 88 years at baseline, including both individuals with and without T2DM. MULTITUDE is an individual-level pooled database of demographics, comorbidities, relevant medications, clinical laboratory values, cardiac health measures, and T2DM-associated events and outcomes across 45 US states and the District of Columbia. Findings to date Among the 135 156 ongoing participants included in the consortium, almost 25\% (33 421) were diagnosed with T2DM at baseline. The average age of the participants was 54.3, while the average age of participants with diabetes was 64.2. Men (55.3\%) and women (44.6\%) were almost equally represented across the consortium. Non-whites accounted for 31.6\% of the total participants and 40\% of those diagnosed with T2DM. Fewer individuals with diabetes reported being regular smokers than their non-diabetic counterparts (40.3\% vs 47.4\%). Over 85\% of those with diabetes were reported as either overweight or obese at baseline, compared with 60.7\% of those without T2DM. We observed differences in all-cause mortality, overall and by T2DM status, between cohorts. Future plans Given the wide variation in demographics and all-cause mortality in the cohorts, MULTITUDE consortium will be a unique resource for conducting research to determine: differences in the incidence and progression of T2DM; sequence of events or biomarkers prior to T2DM diagnosis; disease progression from T2DM to disease-related outcomes, complications and premature mortality; and to assess race/ethnicity differences in the above associations.},

First, we study the standard “global-local shrinkage” approach, based on scale mixtures of normals. Two theorems are presented which characterize certain desirable properties of shrinkage priors for sparse problems. Next, we review some recent results showing how L´evy processes can be used to generate infinite-dimensional versions of standard normal scale-mixture priors, along with new priors that have yet to be seriously studied in the literature. This approach provides an intuitive framework both for generating new regularization penalties and shrinkage rules, and for performing asymptotic analysis on existing models.},

  abstract = {We propose a new Monte Carlo method for sampling from multimodal distributions. The idea of this technique is based on splitting the task into two: finding the modes of a target distribution \$\textbackslash pi\$ and sampling, given the knowledge of the locations of the modes. The sampling algorithm relies on steps of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated with different modes. Besides, the method learns the optimal parameters of the algorithm while it runs, without requiring user intervention. Our technique should be considered as a flexible framework, in which the design of moves can follow various strategies known from the broad MCMC literature. In order to design an adaptive scheme that facilitates both local and jump moves, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing each mode and we define a new target distribution \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash pi\}\$ on an augmented state space \$\textbackslash mathcal\{X\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash times\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mathcal\{X\}\$ is the original state space of \$\textbackslash pi\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\$ is the set of the modes. As the algorithm runs and updates its parameters, the target distribution \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash pi\}\$ also keeps being modified. This motivates a new class of algorithms, Auxiliary Variable Adaptive MCMC. We prove general ergodic results for the whole class before specialising to the case of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {Current intermittent demand inventory control models assume that the demand interval is memoryless: the probability of observing a positive demand does not depend on the time since the last demand occurred. Contrarily, several forecasting contributions suggest that demand intervals contain more distributional information. We find that the data of the M5 forecasting competition confirms this. Therefore, we propose an inventory control model that explicitly uses the full distributions of the demand sizes and intervals and thereby acknowledges that the probability of a demand occurrence may vary throughout the interval. To exploit this information, we also allow for time-varying order-up-to levels that flexibly adjust inventories according to the dynamic requirements. We derive the long-run average holding costs, non-stockout probability, order fill rate, and volume fill rate. Inspired by an analogy with multi-item inventory control models, we propose a greedy marginal-analysis heuristic to optimize the order-up-to levels, which we benchmark against the optimal solution on theoretical instances. In a simulation study on the M5 competition data we demonstrate this method’s improved on-target service performance compared to that of traditional solutions. We furthermore show that target service levels can be achieved at significantly lower costs with time-varying than with fixed order-up-to levels.},

  abstract = {The electricity industry is heavily implementing smart grid technologies to improve reliability, availability, security, and efficiency. This implementation needs technological advancements, the development of standards and regulations, as well as testing and planning. Smart grid load forecasting and management are critical for reducing demand volatility and improving the market mechanism that connects generators, distributors, and retailers. During policy implementations or external interventions, it is necessary to analyse the uncertainty of their impact on the electricity demand to enable a more accurate response of the system to fluctuating demand. This paper analyses the uncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting models using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact distribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on energy usage as a case study to evaluate the non-uniform effect of this intervention on the electricity demand distribution. We could show that during the initial lockdowns in Australia and some European countries, there was often a more significant decrease in the troughs than in the peaks, while the mean remained almost unaffected.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of computing power and efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation algorithms have revolutionized Bayesian statistics, making it a highly practical inference method in applied work. However, MCMC algorithms tend to be computationally demanding, and are particularly slow for large datasets. Data subsampling has recently been suggested as a way to make MCMC methods scalable on massively large data, utilizing efficient sampling schemes and estimators from the survey sampling literature. These developments tend to be unknown by many survey statisticians who traditionally work with non-Bayesian methods, and rarely use MCMC. Our article reviews Subsampling MCMC, a so called pseudo-marginal MCMC approach to speeding up MCMC through data subsampling. The review is written for a survey statistician without previous knowledge of MCMC methods since our aim is to motivate survey sampling experts to contribute to the growing Subsampling MCMC literature.},

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

  abstract = {Global Forecasting Models (GFM) that are trained across a set of multiple time series have shown superior results in many forecasting competitions and real-world applications compared with univariate forecasting approaches. One aspect of the popularity of statistical forecasting models such as ETS and ARIMA is their relative simplicity and interpretability (in terms of relevant lags, trend, seasonality, and others), while GFMs typically lack interpretability, especially towards particular time series. This reduces the trust and confidence of the stakeholders when making decisions based on the forecasts without being able to understand the predictions. To mitigate this problem, in this work, we propose a novel local model-agnostic interpretability approach to explain the forecasts from GFMs. We train simpler univariate surrogate models that are considered interpretable (e.g., ETS) on the predictions of the GFM on samples within a neighbourhood that we obtain through bootstrapping or straightforwardly as the one-step-ahead global black-box model forecasts of the time series which needs to be explained. After, we evaluate the explanations for the forecasts of the global models in both qualitative and quantitative aspects such as accuracy, fidelity, stability and comprehensibility, and are able to show the benefits of our approach.},

Unlike the state-of-the-art, the proposed method simultaneously learns from all time series in the hierarchy and incorporates the reconciliation step into a single trainable model. This is achieved by applying the reparameterization trick and casting reconciliation as an optimization problem with a closed-form solution. These model features make end-to-end learning of hierarchical forecasts possible, while accomplishing the challenging task of generating forecasts that are both probabilistic and coherent. Importantly, our approach also accommodates general aggregation constraints including grouped and temporal hierarchies. An extensive empirical evaluation on real-world hierarchical datasets demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Buildings are one of the major sources of electricity and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) in urban areas all around the world. Since a large integration of solar energy is observed in the form of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, electricity use of buildings is highly uncertain due to intermittent nature of solar output power. This leads to poor energy management for both network operators and building owners. In addition, uncertain metrological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings are big hurdles to accurate prediction of the demand. To improve accuracy of load demand forecast of PV integrated smart building, a hybrid ensemble framework is proposed in this paper. This is based on a combination of five different predictors named as backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (EN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), feed forward neural network (FNN), radial basis function (RBF) and their wavelet transform (WT) models. WT is applied to historical load data to remove the spikes and fluctuations. FNN and RBF network were trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for higher forecast accuracy. The output of each predictor in the ensemble network is combined using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The proposed framework is tested using real data of two practical PV integrated smart buildings in a big university environment. The results indicate that the proposed framework show improvement in average forecast normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) around 17\% and 20\% in seasonal daily and seasonal weekly case studies, respectively. In addition, proposed framework also produces lowest of nRMSE about 3.88\% in seasonal monthly forecast of smart buildings with rooftop PV as compared to benchmark model. The proposed forecast framework provides consistent forecast results for global change institute (GCI) and advance engineering building (AEB) during seasonal daily and weekly comparison.},

However, with the onset of the Greek crisis, debt markets decoupled and the systemic risk of the countries in crisis (excepting Spain) for the European debt market as a whole decreased, whereas that of the non-crisis countries increased to a small degree. The systemic risk of the Greek debt market for other countries in difficulties increased, especially for Portugal where systemic risk tripled after the onset of the crisis, whereas the systemic impact on the non-crisis countries decreased.},

  abstract = {KMV Corporation has created the computer software KMV Credit Monitor, which is supposed to be a predictor for the credit rating migration ¿matrices. Apart from J.P. Morgan's CreditMetrics™ KMV Credit Monitor is the second financial sector-wide standard software. Due to this wide spread of KMV's software products in financial companies and because of its high ¿internal and external influence on the pricing of credit risk it is essential to explain the theoretic framework behind the KMV software. This paper deepens the understanding of this approach when used as credit rating predictor for companies. Unlike CreditMetrics™ that calculates a "Value at Risk due to Credit" KMV uses an equity value based approach to estimate a firm's credit risk. KMV provides a "rating" model rather than a "Value at Risk due to credit" model. The software is based on Merton's (197 4) option pricing approach. This approach is also known as the structural approach of pricing credit risk as it includes the asset-liability structure of a company. The motivation of this paper is to focus on the underlying assumptions of the models and to explain the resulting restrictions. This paper shows advantages and disadvantages of this credit risk measurement method.},

The analysis of such data sets arise commonly in genetical genomics, with X linked to the DNA characteristics and Y corresponding to measurements of fundamental biological processes such as transcription, protein or metabolite production. Building on the Bayesian variable selection set-up for the linear model and associated efficient MCMC algorithms that deal with single responses, we discuss the generic framework of hierarchical related sparse regressions, where parallel regressions of y on the set of cok variates X are linked in a hierarchical fashion, in particular through the prior model of the variable selection indicators γkj , which indicate among the covariates xj those which are associated to the response yk in each multivariate regression. Structures for the joint model of the γkj , which correspond to different compromises between the aims of controlling sparsity and that of enhancing the detection of predictors that are associated with many responses (‘hot spots’), will be discussed and a new multiplicative model for the probability structure of the γkj will be presented. To perform inference for these models in high dimensional set-ups, novel adaptive MCMC algorithms are needed. As sparsity is paramount and most of the associations expected to be zero, new algorithms that progressively focus on part of the space where the most interesting associations occur are of great interest. We shall discuss their formulation and theoretical properties, and demonstrate their use on simulated and real data from genomics.},

We focus particular attention on the situation in which there may be confounding of X and Y , while at the same time measures of the effect of X on Y are of primary interest. In the case where Z has no effect on Y , other than through Z this is the instrumental variable model. Many causal quantities of interest are only partially identified. We first show via examples that the resulting posteriors may be highly sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution over compliance types. We present a ‘transparent’ re-parametrization of the likelihood that addresses this problem by separating the identified and nonidentified parts of the parameter.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become a essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Earlier, Grelaud et al. (2009) advocated the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al., 2008), we now present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

  abstract = {This article reviews new specifications for exponential random graph models proposed by Snijders et al. [Snijders, T.A.B., Pattison, P., Robins, G.L., Handcock, M., 2006. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology] and demonstrates their improvement over homogeneous Markov random graph models in fitting empirical network data. Not only do the new specifications show improvements in goodness of fit for various data sets, but they also help to avoid the problem of near-degeneracy that often afflicts the fitting of Markov random graph models in practice, particularly to network data exhibiting high levels of transitivity. The inclusion of a new higher order transitivity statistic allows estimation of parameters of exponential graph models for many (but not all) cases where it is impossible to estimate parameters of homogeneous Markov graph models. The new specifications were used to model a large number of classical small-scale network data sets and showed a dramatically better performance than Markov graph models. We also review three current programs for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and we compare these Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimates with less accurate pseudo-likelihood estimates. Finally, we discuss whether homogeneous Markov random graph models may be superseded by the new specifications, and how additional elaborations may further improve model performance.},

A non-negativity constraint is imposed on the weights, and several penalties are considered, taking the form of a divergence from a reference combination scheme. In contrast with most of the existing approaches, our framework performs forecast selection and combination in one step, allowing for potentially sparse combining schemes. Moreover, by exploiting the analogy between forecasts combination and portfolio optimization, we provide the analytical expression of the optimal penalty strength when penalizing with the L2-divergence from the equally-weighted scheme. An extensive simulation study and two empirical applications allow us to investigate the impact of the divergence function, the reference scheme, and the non-negativity constraint on the predictive performance. Our results suggest that the proposed models outperform those considered in previous studies.},

  abstract = {Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a relatively new method for time series analysis and comes as a non-parametric alternative to the classical methods. This methodology has proven to be effective in analysing non-stationary and complex time series since it is a nonparametric method and do not require the classical assumptions over the stationarity or over the normality of the residuals. Although SSA have proved to provide advantages over traditional methods, the challenges that arise when long time series are considered, make the standard SSA very demanding computationally and often not suitable. In this paper we propose the randomized SSA which is an alternative to SSA for long time series without losing the quality of the analysis. The SSA and the randomized SSA are compared in terms of quality of the model fit and forecasting, and computational time. This is done by using Monte Carlo simulations and real data about the daily prices of five of the major world commodities.},

To identify the occurrence of abnormal events, we propose a methodology that aims to detect patterns that can lead to abrupt changes in the behavior of the sensor signals. To achieve this objective, we provide a strategy to characterize the time series, and we use a clustering technique to analyze the temporal evolution of the sensor system. To validate our methodology, we propose the clusters’ stability index by windowing. Also, we have developed a parameterizable time series generator, which allows us to represent different operational scenarios for a sensor system where extreme anomalies may arise.},

  abstract = {Dynamic transportation networks have been analyzed for years by means of static graphbased indicators in order to study the temporal evolution of relevant network components, and to reveal complex dependencies that would not be easily detected by a direct inspection of the data. This paper presents a state-of-the-art probabilistic latent network model to forecast multilayer dynamic graphs that are increasingly common in transportation and proposes a community-based extension to reduce the computational burden. Flexible time series analysis is obtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from the models are related to the airlines’ connectivity dynamics, and their ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification of relevant communities. Reliable network predictions would allow policy-makers to better understand the dynamics of the transport system, and help in their planning on e.g. route development, or the deployment of new regulations.},

  abstract = {Providing transport users and operators with accurate forecasts on travel times is challenging due to a highly stochastic traffic environment. Public transport users are particularly sensitive to unexpected waiting times, which negatively affect their perception on the system’s reliability. In this paper we develop a robust model for real-time bus travel time prediction that depart from Gaussian assumptions by using Student-t errors. The proposed approach uses spatiotemporal characteristics from the route and previous bus trips to model short-term effects, and date/time variables and Gaussian processes for long-run forecasts. The model allows for flexible modeling of mean, variance and kurtosis spaces. We propose algorithms for Bayesian inference and for computing probabilistic forecast distributions. Experiments are performed using data from high-frequency buses in Stockholm, Sweden. Results show that Student-t models outperform Gaussian ones in terms of log-posterior predictive power to forecast bus delays at specific stops, which reveals the importance of accounting for predictive uncertainty in model selection. Estimated Student-t regressions capture typical temporal variability between within-day hours and different weekdays. Strong spatiotemporal effects are detected for incoming buses from immediately previous stops, which is in line with many recently developed models. We finally show how Bayesian inference naturally allows for predictive uncertainty quantification, e.g. by returning the predictive probability that the delay of an incoming bus exceeds a given threshold.},

  abstract = {A common approach to statistical learning with big-data is to randomly split it among \$m\$ machines and learn the parameter of interest by averaging the \$m\$ individual estimates. In this paper, focusing on empirical risk minimization, or equivalently M-estimation, we study the statistical error incurred by this strategy. We consider two large-sample settings: First, a classical setting where the number of parameters \$p\$ is fixed, and the number of samples per machine \$n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$. Second, a high-dimensional regime where both \$p,n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$ with \$p/n \textbackslash to \textbackslash kappa \textbackslash in (0,1)\$. For both regimes and under suitable assumptions, we present asymptotically exact expressions for this estimation error. In the fixed-\$p\$ setting, under suitable assumptions, we prove that to leading order averaging is as accurate as the centralized solution. We also derive the second order error terms, and show that these can be non-negligible, notably for non-linear models. The high-dimensional setting, in contrast, exhibits a qualitatively different behavior: data splitting incurs a first-order accuracy loss, which to leading order increases linearly with the number of machines. The dependence of our error approximations on the number of machines traces an interesting accuracy-complexity tradeoff, allowing the practitioner an informed choice on the number of machines to deploy. Finally, we confirm our theoretical analysis with several simulations.},

The ETAS model assumes that the occurrence of mainshock earthquakes follows an inhomogeneous spatial point process, with their aftershock earthquakes modelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters, due to the complexity of the likelihood function and the difficulty in estimating an appropriate spatial mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model, which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the spatial mainshock process, and show how efficient parameter inference can be carried out using auxiliary latent variables. We demonstrate how our model can be used for medium-term earthquake forecasts in a number of geographical regions.},

  abstract = {KMV Corporation has created the computer software KMV Credit Monitor, which is supposed to be a predictor for the credit rating migration ¿matrices. Apart from J.P. Morgan's CreditMetrics™ KMV Credit Monitor is the second financial sector-wide standard software. Due to this wide spread of KMV's software products in financial companies and because of its high ¿internal and external influence on the pricing of credit risk it is essential to explain the theoretic framework behind the KMV software. This paper deepens the understanding of this approach when used as credit rating predictor for companies. Unlike CreditMetrics™ that calculates a "Value at Risk due to Credit" KMV uses an equity value based approach to estimate a firm's credit risk. KMV provides a "rating" model rather than a "Value at Risk due to credit" model. The software is based on Merton's (197 4) option pricing approach. This approach is also known as the structural approach of pricing credit risk as it includes the asset-liability structure of a company. The motivation of this paper is to focus on the underlying assumptions of the models and to explain the resulting restrictions. This paper shows advantages and disadvantages of this credit risk measurement method.},

  abstract = {Predicting the dependencies between observations from multiple time series is critical for applications such as anomaly detection, financial risk management, causal analysis, or demand forecasting. However, the computational and numerical difficulties of estimating time-varying and high-dimensional covariance matrices often limits existing methods to handling at most a few hundred dimensions or requires making strong assumptions on the dependence between series. We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series. We show on several realworld datasets that our method provides significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and perform an ablation study analyzing the contributions of the different components of our model.},

A new recalibration method is introduced that includes adjustments for both unconditional and conditional biases in the mean and variance of the forecast distribution and linear time-dependent bias in the mean. The complexity of the recalibration can be systematically varied by restricting the parameters. Simple recalibration methods may outperform more complex ones given limited training data. A new cross-validation methodology is proposed that allows the comparison of multiple recalibration methods and varying training periods using limited data.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been substantial research on the augmentation of aggregate forecasts with individual consumer data from internet platforms, such as search traffic or social network shares. Although the majority of studies have reported increases in accuracy, many exhibit design weaknesses, including a lack of adequate benchmarks or rigorous evaluation. Furthermore, their usefulness over the product life-cycle has not been investigated, even though this may change, as consumers may search initially for pre-purchase information, but later for after-sales support. This study begins by reviewing the relevant literature, then attempts to support the key findings using two forecasting case studies. Our findings are in stark contrast to those in the previous literature, as we find that established univariate forecasting benchmarks, such as exponential smoothing, consistently perform better those that include online information. Our research underlines the need for a thorough forecast evaluation and argues that the usefulness of online platform data for supporting operational decisions may be limited.},

  abstract = {Data sets with complex relationships between random variables are increasingly studied in statistical applications. A popular approach to model their dependence is the use of copula functions. Our contribution is to derive expressions for the observed and expected information for several bivariate copula families, in particular for the Student’s t-copula. Further likelihood derivatives which are required for numerical implementations are computed and a numerically stable implementation is provided in the R-package VineCopula. Using a real world data set of stock returns, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach for the routinely calculation of standard errors. In particular, we illustrate how this prevents overestimating the time-variation of dependence parameters in a rolling window analysis.},

Our approach is based on a continuous mixture of independent Poisson distributions. The mixing component is able to capture correlation among components of the observed vector and across space through the use of a linear model of coregionalization. We introduce here the use of covariates to allow for possible non-stationarity of the covariance structure of the mixing component. We analyze joint spatial variation of counts of four fish species abundant in Lake Saint Pierre, Quebec, Canada. Models allowing the covariance structure of the spatial random effects to depend on a covariate, geodetic lake depth, showed improved fit relative to stationary models.},

  abstract = {The automated detection of sequential anomalies in time series is an essential task for many applications, such as the monitoring of technical systems, fraud detection in high-frequency trading, or the early detection of disease symptoms. All these applications require the detection to find all sequential anomalies possibly fast on potentially very large time series. In other words, the detection needs to be effective, efficient and scalable w.r.t. the input size. Series2Graph is an effective solution based on graph embeddings that are robust against re-occurring anomalies and can discover sequential anomalies of arbitrary length and works without training data. Yet, Series2Graph is no t scalable due to its single-threaded approach; it cannot, in particular, process arbitrarily large sequences due to the memory constraints of a single machine. In this paper, we propose our distributed anomaly detection system, short DADS, which is an efficient and scalable adaptation of Series2Graph. Based on the actor programming model, DADS distributes the input time sequence, intermediate state and the computation to all processors of a cluster in a way that minimizes communication costs and synchronization barriers. Our evaluation shows that DADS is orders of magnitude faster than S2G, scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the cluster and can process much larger input sequences due to its scale-out property.},

Graphics processing units can alleviate the processor bottleneck, but memory or disk bottlenecks can only be eliminated by splitting data across multiple machines. Communication between large numbers of machines is expensive (regardless of the amount of data being communicated), so there is a need for algorithms that perform distributed approximate Bayesian analyses with minimal communication. Consensus Monte Carlo operates by running a separate Monte Carlo algorithm on each machine, and then averaging individual Monte Carlo draws across machines. Depending on the model, the resulting draws can be nearly indistinguishable from the draws that would have been obtained by running a single-machine algorithm for a very long time. Examples of consensus Monte Carlo are shown for simple models where single-machine solutions are available, for large single-layer hierarchical models, and for Bayesian additive regression trees (BART).},

The R package GA provides a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms. This paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version 3 of the package. In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser. Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing. Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several examples of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions, showing that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Although generous return policies have been shown to have marketing benefits, such as a higher willingness to pay and a higher purchase frequency, counterbalancing these benefits is an increased volume of consumer returns, which presents significant operational challenges for both retailers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20\%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns. Last, we discuss broad implications of return forecast accuracy improvements in the areas such as inventory management, staffing level, reverse logistics, and return recovery decisions.},

  abstract = {We consider distributed statistical optimization in one-shot setting, where there are m machines each observing n i.i.d. samples. Based on its observed samples, each machine then sends an O(log(mn))-length message to a server, at which a parameter minimizing an expected loss is to be estimated. We propose an algorithm called Multi-Resolution Estimator (MRE) whose expected error is no larger than O˜ m−1/max(d,2)n−1/2 , where d is the dimension of the parameter space. This error bound meets existing lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors, and is thereby order optimal. The expected error of MRE, unlike existing algorithms, tends to zero as the number of machines (m) goes to infinity, even when the number of samples per machine (n) remains upper bounded by a constant. This property of the MRE algorithm makes it applicable in new machine learning paradigms where m is much larger than n.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a novel approach for multiple time series forecasting. At first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for multiple short time series. Experiments conducted on three public datasets and two industrial datasets verify that the proposed BHT-ARIMA effectively improves forecasting accuracy and reduces computational cost compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Many internet platforms that collect behavioral big data use it to predict user behavior for internal purposes and for their business customers (e.g., advertisers, insurers, security forces, governments, political consulting firms) who utilize the predictions for personalization, targeting, and other decision-making. Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better prediction accuracy by pushing users’ behaviors towards their predicted values, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more certain predictions. Such apparent “improved” prediction can result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl’s causal do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error given behavior modification and identify the components impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users’ behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent predictability might not generalize when business customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers’ intentions, and harmful to manipulated users.},

My customized machine learning models can successfully predict both stock returns and fund performance, and a nonlinear model delivers better performance. While existing studies find that technical signals play a dominant role in return prediction, I show that after accounting for high correlations among variables, fundamental stock characteristics are more influential than originally documented. Across funds, performance varies widely with fund exposure to anomalies; however, the aggregate performance of funds does not benefit from fund trading on market anomalies. I also find that the negative relation between stock selection and market timing – a long-standing intrigue in the fund literature – is not due to fund pursuit of anomaly-based investment strategies.},

  abstract = {Spatial whole-brain Bayesian modeling of task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a great computational challenge. Most of the currently proposed methods therefore do inference in subregions of the brain separately or do approximate inference without comparison to the true posterior distribution. A popular such method, which is now the standard method for Bayesian single subject analysis in the SPM software, is introduced in Penny et al. (2005b). The method processes the data slice-by-slice and uses an approximate variational Bayes (VB) estimation algorithm that enforces posterior independence between activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a fast and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for exact inference in the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole brain using a 3D prior on activity coefficients. The algorithm exploits sparsity and uses modern techniques for efficient sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, leading to speed-ups without which MCMC would not be a practical option. Using MCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate VB posterior against the exact MCMC posterior, and show that VB can lead to spurious activation. In addition, we develop an improved VB method that drops the assumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be much faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large datasets, with negligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.},

This article introduces a fast Rao–Blackwellized Monte Carlo samplingbased method for efficiently approximating selected elements of the covariance matrix. The variance and confidence bounds of the approximations can be precisely estimated without additional computational costs. Furthermore, a method that iterates over subdomains is introduced, and is shown to additionally reduce the approximation errors to practically negligible levels in an application on functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

We compare the copula based proposal to an adaptive proposal density based on a multivariate mixture of normals and an adaptive random walk Metropolis proposal. We also introduce a refinement of the random walk proposal which performs better for multimodal target distributions. We compare the sampling schemes using challenging but realistic models and priors applied to real data examples. The results show that for the examples studied, the adaptive independent Metropolis-Hastings proposals are much more efficient than the adaptive random walk proposals and that in general the copula based proposal has the best acceptance rates and lowest inefficiencies.},

  abstract = {Wind speed modelling is of increasing interest, both for basic research and for applications, as, e.g., for wind turbine development and strategies to construct large wind power plants. Generally, such modelling is hampered by the non-stationary features of wind speed data that, to a large extent, reflect the turbulent dynamics in the atmosphere. We study how these features can be captured by nested ARIMA models. In this approach, wind speed fluctuations in given time windows are modelled by one stochastic process, and the parameter variation between successive windows by another one. For deriving the wind speed model, we use 20 months of data collected at the FINO1 platform at the North Sea and use a variable transformation that best maps the wind speed onto a Gaussian random variable. We find that wind speed increments can be well reproduced for up to four standard deviations. The distributions of extreme variations, however, strongly deviate from the model predictions.},

The focus will be on methodological issues, which arise when applying statistical methods to sample survey data and will discuss in detail the impact of complex sampling schemes. Further issues, such as how to deal with missing data and measurement of error will also be critically discussed. There have significant improvements in statistical software which implement complex sampling schemes (eg SUDAAN, STATA, WESVAR, PC CARP ) in the last decade and there is greater need for practical advice for those analysing survey data. To ensure a broad audience, the statistical theory will be made accessible through the use of practical examples. This book will be accessible to a broad audience of statisticians but will primarily be of interest to practitioners analysing survey data. Increased awareness by social scientists of the variety of powerful statistical methods will make this book a useful reference.},

  abstract = {Copula models have become one of the most widely used tools in the applied modelling of multivariate data. Similarly, Bayesian methods are increasingly used to obtain efficient likelihood-based inference. However, to date, there has been only limited use of Bayesian approaches in the formulation and estimation of copula models. This article aims to address this shortcoming in two ways. First, to introduce copula models and aspects of copula theory that are especially relevant for a Bayesian analysis. Second, to outline Bayesian approaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages over alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas constructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as transformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for Bayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes for fitting Gaussian and D-vine copulas, with and without selection, are given in detail. The relationship between the prior for the parameters of a D-vine, and the prior for a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula, is discussed. Last, it is shown how to compute Bayesian inference when the data are discrete-valued using data augmentation. This approach generalises popular Bayesian methods for the estimation of models for multivariate binary and other ordinal data to more general copula models. Bayesian data augmentation has substantial advantages over other methods of estimation for this class of models.},

Here we show one can usually obtain the same learning curve on both training and test sets by instead increasing the batch size during training. This procedure is successful for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Nesterov momentum, and Adam. It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate and scaling the batch size B ∝ . Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient m and scale B ∝ 1/(1 − m), although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning. We train ResNet-50 on ImageNet to 76.1\% validation accuracy in under 30 minutes.},

  abstract = {Variational methods are attractive for computing Bayesian inference for highly parametrized models and large datasets where exact inference is impractical. They approximate a target distribution—either the posterior or an augmented posterior—using a simpler distribution that is selected to balance accuracy with computational feasibility. Here we approximate an element-wise parametric transformation of the target distribution as multivariate Gaussian or skew-normal. Approximations of this kind are implicit copula models for the original parameters, with a Gaussian or skew-normal copula function and flexible parametric margins. A key observation is that their adoption can improve the accuracy of variational inference in high dimensions at limited or no additional computational cost. We consider the Yeo-Johnson and G\&H transformations, along with sparse factor structures for the scale matrix of the Gaussian or skew-normal. We also show how to implement efficient reparametrization gradient methods for these copula-based approximations. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated by computing posterior inference for three different models using six real datasets. In each case, we show that our proposed copula model distributions are more accurate variational approximations than Gaussian or skew-normal distributions, but at only a minor or no increase in computational cost.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a “black art” requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm’s generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Recently published functional graphical models rely on the multivariate Gaussian process assumption, but we relax it by introducing the functional copula Gaussian graphical model (FCGGM). This model removes the marginal Gaussian assumption but retains the simplicity of the Gaussian dependence structure, which is particularly attractive for large data. We develop four estimators for the FCGGM and establish the consistency and the convergence rates of one of them. We compare our FCGGM with the existing functional Gaussian graphical model by simulations, and apply our method to an EEG dataset to construct brain networks.

The approach proposed consists of two stages: split the ultrahigh dimensional data set into a number of lower dimensional subsets and select relevant variables from each of the subsets, and aggregate the variables selected from each subset and then select relevant variables from the aggregated data set. Since the approach proposed has an embarrassingly parallel structure, it can be easily implemented in a parallel architecture and applied to big data problems with millions or more of explanatory variables. Under mild conditions, we show that the approach proposed is consistent, i.e. the true explanatory variables can be correctly identified by the approach as the sample size becomes large. Extensive comparisons of the approach proposed have been made with penalized likelihood approaches, such as the lasso, elastic net, sure independence screening and iterative sure independence screening. The numerical results show that the approach proposed generally outperforms penalized likelihood approaches: the models selected by the approach tend to be more sparse and closer to the true model.},

  abstract = {Over the last 15 years, studies on hierarchical forecasting have moved away from single-level approaches towards proposing linear combination approaches across multiple levels of the hierarchy. Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved postsample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

  abstract = {The method of model averaging has become an important tool to deal with model uncertainty, for example in situations where a large amount of different theories exist, as are common in economics. Model averaging is a natural and formal response to model uncertainty in a Bayesian framework, and most of the paper deals with Bayesian model averaging. The important role of the prior assumptions in these Bayesian procedures is highlighted. In addition, frequentist model averaging methods are also discussed. Numerical methods to implement these methods are explained, and I point the reader to some freely available computational resources. The main focus is on uncertainty regarding the choice of covariates in normal linear regression models, but the paper also covers other, more challenging, settings, with particular emphasis on sampling models commonly used in economics. Applications of model averaging in economics are reviewed and discussed in a wide range of areas, among which growth economics, production modelling, finance and forecasting macroeconomic quantities.

This is particularly true for patients suffering from multiple chronic diseases. The contribution is to introduce a novel model for multivariate data where some response variables are discrete and some are continuous. It is based on pair copula constructions (PCCs) and has two major advantages over existing methodology. First, expressing the joint dependence structure in terms of bivariate copulas leads to a computationally advantageous expression for the likelihood function. This makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for large multidimensional data sets. Second, different and possibly asymmetric bivariate (conditional) marginal distributions are allowed which is necessary to accurately describe the limiting behavior of conditional distributions for mixed discrete and continuous responses. The advantages and the favorable predictive performance of the model are demonstrated using data from the Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II).},

The methodology involves least squares and maximum likelihood estimation, stepwise addition of basis functions using Rao statistics, stepwise deletion using Wald statistics and model selection using the Bayesian information criterion, cross-validation or an independent test set. Publicly available software, written in C and interfaced to S/S-PLUS, is used to apply this methodology to real data.},

  abstract = {Functional clustering is based on functional similarity measures that are adapted to functional data. However, the existing functional similarity measures account either for the position (value) or temporal deviation (bias) of extreme points of the functional curves. This may lead to erroneous conclusions on the similarities of the curves. In this case, most functional clustering measures underperform in (for example) the analysis of stock market data. To address this methodological limitation, a new similarity measure that is based on extreme point bias compensation is proposed in this paper. By penalizing the curves with the temporal deviation of extreme points and rewarding the curves that are close to each other, the new similarity measure better reflects the shape of the curve. In addition, the proposed method overcomes the difficulty of unifying the dimensions of the horizontal and vertical axes (i.e., time and function value) when calculating the distance between two adjacent extreme points. Finally, an empirical example of stock return analysis verifies the validity of this new measure.},

The key idea is to first quantize the computed gradients, and then skip less informative quantized gradient communications by reusing outdated gradients. Quantizing and skipping result in ‘lazy’ worker-server communications, which justifies the term Lazily Aggregated Quantized gradient that is henceforth abbreviated as LAQ. Our LAQ can provably attain the same linear convergence rate as the gradient descent in the strongly convex case, while effecting major savings in the communication overhead both in transmitted bits as well as in communication rounds. Empirically, experiments with real data corroborate a significant communication reduction compared to existing gradient- and stochastic gradient-based algorithms.},

  abstract = {Forecasting and planning for inventory management has received considerable attention from the Operational Research (OR) community over the last 50 years because of its implications for decision making, both at the strategic level of an organization and at the operational level. Many influential contributions have been made in this area, reflecting different perspectives that have evolved in divergent strands of the literature, namely: system dynamics, control theory and forecasting theory (both statistical and judgemental). Although this pluralism is healthy in terms of knowledge advancement, it also signifies the fragmentation of the OR discipline and the lack of cross-fertilization of ideas to develop more comprehensive approaches towards the resolution of the same issues. In this paper, the relevant literature is reviewed and synthesized to promote some convergence between these different approaches to inventory forecasting and planning. The review concludes with an inter-disciplinary agenda for further research.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel meta-learning algorithm for time series forecast model performance prediction. We model the forecast error as a function of time series features calculated from historical time series with an efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach. The minimum predicted forecast error is then used to identify an individual model or a combination of models to produce the final forecasts. It is well known that the performance of most meta-learning models depends on the representativeness of the reference dataset used for training. In such circumstances, we augment the reference dataset with a feature-based time series simulation approach, namely GRATIS, to generate a rich and representative time series collection. The proposed framework is tested using the M4 competition data and is compared against commonly used forecasting approaches. Our approach provides comparable performance to other model selection and combination approaches but at a lower computational cost and a higher degree of interpretability, which is important for supporting decisions. We also provide useful insights regarding which forecasting models are expected to work better for particular types of time series, the intrinsic mechanisms of the meta-learners, and how the forecasting performance is affected by various factors.},

  abstract = {Features of time series are useful in identifying suitable models for forecasting. We present a general framework, labelled Feature-based FORecast Model Selection (FFORMS), which selects forecast models based on features calculated from each time series. The FFORMS framework builds a mapping that relates the features of a time series to the “best” forecast model using a classification algorithm such as a random forest. The framework is evaluated using time series from the M-forecasting competitions and is shown to yield forecasts that are almost as accurate as state-of-the-art methods but are much faster to compute. We use model-agnostic machine learning interpretability methods to explore the results and to study what types of time series are best suited to each forecasting model.},

  abstract = {We propose Bayesian inference for the factor copula model proposed by Krupskii \& Joe (2013). There are two significant advantages that Bayesian inference has over classical inference for this model. The first is that it is straightforward to conduct inference on the latent factor since iterates of the latent factor are generated in our Markov chain Monte Carlo, whereas in classical inference the latent factor is integrated out of the likelihood using quadrature methods. Second, by developing a Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme we are able to select a factor copula model or average over different models by selecting bivariate copula building blocks from a large set of candidate parametric families. Through extensive simulation studies where we consider multiple schemes, we develop an algorithm that balances computational and Monte Carlo efficiency, provides reliable inference on all parameters including the latent factor and successfully explores a large model space. The potential of the approach is demonstrated using financial returns data on up to 26 different economies. The estimated factor correlates with known global economic shocks and asymmetric tail dependence in uncovered for some markets.},

It is also useful when the data contains sensitive information, and it is desirable to avoid using the original data set as much as possible (example: medical data). We test our proposal on benchmark data sets using different network architectures, and show that a Decision Tree (DT) classifier trained using the training data generated by the GAN reached the same, (and surprisingly sometimes better), accuracy and recall than a DT trained on the original data set.},

It is believed that comparing and synthesizing multiple models’ simulations is key to quantify a best estimate of the future changes and its uncertainty. In the last few years there has been an explosion of literature in the climate change science where mostly heuristic methods of synthesizing multiple models’ output have been proposed, and the statistical literature is showing more involvement by our community as well of late. In this paper we give a brief overview of the main streams of research in this area and then focus on our recent work, through which we have proposed the framework of hierarchical Bayesian models to combine information from model simulations and observations, in order to derive posterior probabilities of temperature and precipitation change at regional scales.},

The basic idea is that parameters are endowed with distributions which may themselves introduce new parameters, and this construction recurses. In this review we discuss the role of hierarchical modeling in Bayesian nonparametrics, focusing on models in which the infinite-dimensional parameters are treated hierarchically. For example, we consider a model in which the base measure for a Dirichlet process is itself treated as a draw from another Dirichlet process. This yields a natural recursion that we refer to as a hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discuss hierarchies based on the Pitman-Yor process and on completely random processes. We demonstrate the value of these hierarchical constructions in a wide range of practical applications, in problems in computational biology, computer vision and natural language processing.},

This algorithm uses amortized inference in a deep generative model to perform joint posterior predictive inference of mini-batch gradient computation times in a compute cluster specific manner. Specifically, our algorithm mitigates the straggler effect in synchronous, gradient-based optimization by choosing an optimal cutoff beyond which mini-batch gradient messages from slow workers are ignored. The principle novel contribution and finding of this work goes beyond this by demonstrating that using the predicted run-times from a generative model of cluster worker performance improves over the static-cutoff prior art, leading to higher gradient computation throughput on large compute clusters. In our experiments we show that eagerly discarding the mini-batch gradient computations of stragglers not only increases throughput but sometimes also increases the overall rate of convergence as a function of wall-clock time by virtue of eliminating idleness.},

Thus, Phase LIB trials are inherently comparative even though a standard therapy arm usually is not included. Uncertainty regarding the response rate Os of S is rarely made explicit, either in planning the trial or interpreting its results. We propose practical Bayesian guidelines for deciding whether E is promising relative to S in settings where patient response is binary and the data are monitored continuously. The design requires specification of an informative prior for Os, a targ improvement for E, and bounds on the allowed sample size. No explicit specification of a loss function is required. Sampling continues until E is shown to be either promising or not promising relative to S with high posterior probability, or the maximum sample size is reached.

  abstract = {The main objective of the M5 competition, which focused on forecasting the hierarchical unit sales of Walmart, was to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of forecasting methods in the field to identify best practices and highlight their practical implications. However, can the findings of the M5 competition be generalized and exploited by retail firms to better support their decisions and operation? This depends on the extent to which M5 data is sufficiently similar to unit sales data of retailers operating in different regions selling different product types and considering different marketing strategies. To answer this question, we analyze the characteristics of the M5 time series and compare them with those of two grocery retailers, namely Corporación Favorita and a major Greek supermarket chain, using feature spaces. Our results suggest only minor discrepancies between the examined data sets, supporting the representativeness of the M5 data.},

Most high-dimensional tests for the equality of two mean vectors rely on naive diagonal or trace estimators of the covariance matrix, ignoring dependences between variables. A test using random subspaces is proposed, which offers higher power when the variables are dependent and is invariant under linear transformations of the marginal distributions. The p-values for the test are obtained using permutations. The test does not rely on assumptions about normality or the structure of the covariance matrix. It is shown by simulation that the new test has higher power than competing tests in realistic settings motivated by microarray gene expression data. Computational aspects of high-dimensional permutation tests are also discussed and an efficient R implementation of the proposed test is provided.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is crucial for many fields, such as disaster warning, weather prediction, and energy consumption. The Transformer-based models are considered to have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling. However, the complex temporal patterns of the time series hinder the model from mining reliable temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the autoregressive form of the Transformer introduces cumulative errors in the inference step. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic decomposition Transformer model that combines the Transformer with a conditional generative model, which provides hierarchical and interpretable probabilistic forecasts for intricate time series. The Transformer is employed to learn temporal patterns and implement primary probabilistic forecasts, while the conditional generative model is used to achieve non-autoregressive hierarchical probabilistic forecasts by introducing latent space feature representations. In addition, the conditional generative model reconstructs typical features of the series, such as seasonality and trend terms, from probability distributions in the latent space to enable complex pattern separation and provide interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model, indicating that it compares favorably with the state of the art.},

  abstract = {In economics, insurance and finance, value at risk (VaR) is a widely used measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability α, the 100α\% VaR is defined as a threshold loss value, such that the probability that the loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value is α. That is to say, it is a quantile of the distribution of the losses, which has both good analytic properties and easy interpretation as a risk measure. However, its extension to the multivariate framework is not unique because a unique definition of multivariate quantile does not exist. In the current literature, the multivariate quantiles are related to a specific partial order considered in Rn, or to a property of the univariate quantile that is desirable to be extended to Rn. In this work, we introduce a multivariate value at risk as a vector-valued directional risk measure, based on a directional multivariate quantile, which has recently been introduced in the literature. The directional approach allows the manager to consider external information or risk preferences in her/his analysis. We derive some properties of the risk measure and we compare the univariate VaR over the marginals with the components of the directional multivariate VaR. We also analyze the relationship between some families of copulas, for which it is possible to obtain closed forms of the multivariate VaR that we propose. Finally, comparisons with other alternative multivariate VaR given in the literature, are provided in terms of robustness.},

Deep neural networks have proved to be powerful and are achieving high accuracy in many application fields. For these reasons, they are one of the most widely used methods of machine learning to solve problems dealing with big data nowadays. In this work, the time series forecasting problem is initially formulated along with its mathematical fundamentals. Then, the most common deep learning architectures that are currently being successfully applied to predict time series are described, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Particular attention is given to feed forward networks, recurrent neural networks (including Elman, long-short term memory, gated recurrent units, and bidirectional networks), and convolutional neural networks. Practical aspects, such as the setting of values for hyperparameters and the choice of the most suitable frameworks, for the successful application of deep learning to time series are also provided and discussed. Several fruitful research fields in which the architectures analyzed have obtained a good performance are reviewed. As a result, research gaps have been identified in the literature for several domains of application, thus expecting to inspire new and better forms of knowledge.},

We then propose a simple strategy to optimize the classifier performance, that employs different train and test resolutions. It relies on a computationally cheap fine-tuning of the network at the test resolution. This enables training strong classifiers using small training images, and therefore significantly reduce the training time. For instance, we obtain 77.1\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a ResNet50 trained on 128⇥128 images, and 79.8\% with one trained at 224⇥224.},

  abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB) is rapidly becoming a popular tool for Bayesian inference in statistical modeling. However, the existing VB algorithms are restricted to cases where the likelihood is tractable, which precludes their use in many interesting situations such as in state–space models and in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), where application of VB methods was previously impossible. This article extends the scope of application of VB to cases where the likelihood is intractable, but can be estimated unbiasedly. The proposed VB method therefore makes it possible to carry out Bayesian inference in many statistical applications, including state–space models and ABC. The method is generic in the sense that it can be applied to almost all statistical models without requiring too much model-based derivation, which is a drawback of many existing VB algorithms. We also show how the proposed method can be used to obtain highly accurate VB approximations of marginal posterior distributions. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

  abstract = {We develop a general variational inference method that preserves dependency among the latent variables. Our method uses copulas to augment the families of distributions used in mean-field and structured approximations. Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning—a key tool for performing meta-learning—learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression—in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features, showing that our algorithms are optimal up to logarithmic factors.},

Analysts performing signal processing are forced to wait hours or days for results, which results in a disruption of their workflow and a decrease in productivity. In this paper we present a unique approach that not only parallelizes the workload over multi-cores, but distributes the problem over a cluster of graphics processing unit (GPU)-equipped servers. By utilizing Hadoop and CUDA, we can take advantage of inexpensive servers while still exceeding the processing power of a dedicated supercomputer, as demonstrated in our result using Amazon EC2.},

The installed base is defined as the set of products (or machines) in use where the part is installed. Information on the number of products still in use, the age of the products, the age of their parts, as well as the part reliability may indicate when a part will fail and trigger a demand for a new spare part. The current literature is unclear which of this installed base information adds most value – and should thus be collected – for inventory control purposes. For this reason, we evaluate the inventory performance of eight methods that include different sets of installed base information in their demand forecasts. Using a comparative simulation study we identify that knowing the size of the active installed base is most valuable, especially when the installed base changes over time. We also find that when a failure-based prediction model is used, it is important to work with the part age itself, rather than the machine age. When one is not able to collect information on the part age, a logistic regression on the machine age might be a valuable alternative to a failure-based prediction model. Our findings may support the prioritization of data collection for spare part demand forecasting and inventory control.},

One such example is the analysis of genomics data. In this paper we first review Bayesian variable selection methods for linear settings, including regression and classification models. We focus in particular on recent prior constructions that have been used for the analysis of genomic data and briefly describe two novel applications that integrate different sources of biological information into the analysis of experimental data. Next, we address variable selection for a different modeling context, i.e. mixture models. We address both clustering and discriminant analysis settings and conclude with an application to gene expression data for patients affected by leukemia.},

We consider dependence or concordance measures that are solely functions of the copula, because they contain no marginal information: rank correlation coefficients or tail-dependence coefficients represent natural choices. We propose a maximum penalized log-likelihood estimator, √ derive its n-consistency and asymptotic normality, discuss details of the estimation procedure and the selection of the smoothing parameter. Finally, we present the results from a simulation study and apply the new methodology to a real dataset. Using intraday asset returns, we show that an intraday dependence pattern, due to the cyclical nature of market activity, is shaped similarly to the individual conditional second moments.},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01–0.07 σ) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1–0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

  abstract = {Independent component analysis is a standard tool in modern data analysis and numerous different techniques for applying it exist. The standard methods however quickly lose their effectiveness when the data are made up of structures of higher order than vectors, namely matrices or tensors (for example, images or videos), being unable to handle the high amounts of noise. Recently, an extension of the classic fourth order blind identification (FOBI) specially suited for tensor-valued observations was proposed and showed to outperform its vector version for tensor data. In this paper we extend another popular independent component analysis method, the joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices (JADE), for tensor observations. In addition to the theoretical background we also provide the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and use both simulations and real data to show its usefulness and superiority over its competitors. Supplementary material including the proofs of the theorems and the codes for running the simulations and the real data example are available online.},

In [Teh et al., 2014], we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.},

  abstract = {We capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled video in order to learn a model of scene dynamics for both video recognition tasks (e.g. action classification) and video generation tasks (e.g. future prediction). We propose a generative adversarial network for video with a spatio-temporal convolutional architecture that untangles the scene’s foreground from the background. Experiments suggest this model can generate tiny videos up to a second at full frame rate better than simple baselines, and we show its utility at predicting plausible futures of static images. Moreover, experiments and visualizations show the model internally learns useful features for recognizing actions with minimal supervision, suggesting scene dynamics are a promising signal for representation learning. We believe generative video models can impact many applications in video understanding and simulation.},

To aggregate expert predictions, we use the AdaHedge algorithm, which is a version of the Hedge algorithm with adaptive learning rate, and extend it by the meta-algorithm Fixed Share. Due to this, we combine the advantages of both algorithms: (1) we use the shifting regret which is a more optimal characteristic of the algorithm; (2) regret bounds are valid in the case of signed unbounded losses of the experts. Also, (3) we incorporate in this scheme a “smooth” version of the method of specialized experts which allows us to make more flexible and accurate predictions. All results are obtained in the adversarial setting—no assumptions are made about the nature of the data source. We present results of numerical experiments for short-term forecasting of electricity consumption based on real data.},

An overview of Bayesian cluster analysis is provided, including both model-based and loss-based approaches, along with a discussion on the importance of the kernel or loss selected and prior specification. Advantages are demonstrated in an application to cluster cells and discover latent cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing data to study embryonic cellular development. Lastly, we focus on the ongoing debate between finite and infinite mixtures in a model-based approach and robustness to model misspecification. While much of the debate and asymptotic theory focuses on the marginal posterior of the number of clusters, we empirically show that quite a different behaviour is obtained when estimating the full clustering structure.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

An appealing aspect of this approach is that computations are relatively easy. In this paper, we examine the predictive performance of these models with an increasing number of covariates. Even for a moderate number of covariates, we find that the likelihood for x tends to dominate the posterior of the latent random partition, degrading the predictive performance of the model. To overcome this, we suggest using a different nonparametric prior, namely an enriched Dirichlet process. Our proposal maintains a simple allocation rule, so that computations remain relatively simple. Advantages are shown through both predictive equations and examples, including an application to diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease.},

Within this class, there are few inferentially viable models available, and we propose one further model. More problematic are the restrictive assumptions that must be made when using max-stable processes to model dependence for spatial extremes: it must be assumed that the dependence structure of the observed extremes is compatible with a limiting model that holds for all events more extreme than those that have already occurred. This problem has long been acknowledged in the context of finite-dimensional multivariate extremes, in particular when data display dependence at observable levels, but are independent in the limit. We propose a flexible class of models that is suitable for such data in a spatial context. In addition, we consider the situation where the extremal dependence structure may vary with distance. We apply our models to spatially referenced significant wave height data from the North Sea, finding evidence that their extremal structure is not compatible with a limiting dependence model.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method, we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold. Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents comprehensive empirical evidence on the dynamics and causality within 30 US industry-specific volatilities during July 1963 and June 2008. We find that linear trends are present in 17 of the 30 industry volatilities. Granger-causality tests reveal that the industry of business supplies and the industry of finance are the most important lead indicators of industry volatilities. To uncover contemporaneous causal relationships in the market, we implement an emerging data-driven method of directed acyclic graphs. The results suggest that volatility shocks originating from business supplies, machinery, and consumer goods industries are sources of risks that affect most other industries. By contrast, volatilities in the two traditionally important industries, oil and autos, do not appear to have a substantial influence on other large industries in the contemporaneous time. Finally, business equipment and services, both containing information technology components, are the most important driving forces of the industry volatility surge in the late 1990s.},

  abstract = {It is well known that for major infrastructure networks such as electricity, gas, railway, road, and urban water networks, disruptions at one point have a knock-on effect throughout the network. There is an impressive amount of individual research projects examining the vulnerability of critical infrastructure network. However, there is little understanding of the totality of the contribution made by these projects and their interrelationships. This makes their review a difficult process for both new and established researchers in the field. To address this issue, a two-step literature review process is used to provide an overview of the vulnerability of the transportation network in terms of four main themes—research objective, transportation mode, disruption scenario, and vulnerability indicator—involving the analysis of related articles from 2001 to 2013. Two limitations of existing research are identified: (1) the limited amount of studies relating to multilayer transportation network vulnerability analysis, and (2) the lack of evaluation methods to explore the relationship between structure vulnerability and dynamical functional vulnerability. In addition to indicating that more attention needs to be paid to these two aspects in the future, the analysis provides a new avenue for the discovery of knowledge, as well as an improved understanding of transportation network vulnerability.

  abstract = {For massive data, the family of subsampling algorithms is popular to downsize the data volume and reduce computational burden. Existing studies focus on approximating the ordinary least-square estimate in linear regression, where statistical leverage scores are often used to define subsampling probabilities. In this article, we propose fast subsampling algorithms to efficiently approximate the maximum likelihood estimate in logistic regression. We first establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a general subsampling algorithm, and then derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the asymptotic mean squared error of the resultant estimator. An alternative minimization criterion is also proposed to further reduce the computational cost. The optimal subsampling probabilities depend on the full data estimate, so we develop a two-step algorithm to approximate the optimal subsampling procedure. This algorithm is computationally efficient and has a significant reduction in computing time compared to the full data approach. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a two-step algorithm are also established. Synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed method. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or dependent time series is a practically relevant and challenging task. Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data, and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes. Their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient, and allows them to provide uncertainty estimates. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efficiency, accuracy and computational complexity.},

  abstract = {The classical vector autoregressive model is a fundamental tool for multivariate time series analysis. However, it involves too many parameters when the number of time series and lag order are even moderately large. This paper proposes to rearrange the coefficient matrices of the model into a tensor form such that the parameter space can be restricted in three directions simultaneously via tensor decomposition. The proposed method substantially expands the capacity of vector autoregressive modeling for a large number of time series. In contrast, the widely used reduced-rank regression method can restrict the parameter space in only one direction. Moreover, to handle high-dimensional time series, this paper considers imposing sparsity on factor matrices to improve the interpretability and estimation efficiency, which leads to a sparsity-inducing estimator. For the low-dimensional case, we derive asymptotic properties of the proposed least squares estimator and introduce an alternating least squares algorithm. For the high-dimensional case, we establish non-asymptotic properties of the sparsity-inducing estimator and propose an ADMM-based algorithm for regularized estimation. Simulation experiments and a real data example demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over various existing methods.},

  abstract = {Divide-and-conquer Bayesian methods consist of three steps: dividing the data into smaller computationally manageable subsets, running a sampling algorithm in parallel on all the subsets, and combining parameter draws from all the subsets. The combined parameter draws are used for efficient posterior inference in massive data settings. A major restriction of existing divide-and-conquer methods is that their first two steps assume that the observations are independent. We address this problem by developing a divide-and-conquer method for Bayesian inference in parametric hidden Markov models, where the state space is known and finite. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, after partitioning the data into smaller blocks of consecutive observations, we modify the likelihood for performing posterior computations on the subsets such that the posterior variances of the subset and true posterior distributions have the same asymptotic order. Second, if the number of subsets is chosen appropriately depending on the mixing properties of the hidden Markov chain, then we show that the subset posterior distributions defined using the modified likelihood are asymptotically normal as the subset sample size tends to infinity. The latter result also implies that we can use any existing combination algorithm in the third step. We show that the combined posterior distribution obtained using one such algorithm is close to the true posterior distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance under widely used regularity assumptions. Our numerical results show that the proposed method provides an accurate approximation of the true posterior distribution than its competitors in diverse simulation studies and a real data analysis.},

This paper develops a novel distributed forecasting framework to tackle the challenges of forecasting ultra-long time series using the industry-standard MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach retains the local time dependency. It utilizes a straightforward splitting across samples to facilitate distributed forecasting by combining the local estimators of time series models delivered from worker nodes and minimizing a global loss function. Instead of unrealistically assuming the data generating process (DGP) of an ultra-long time series stays invariant, we only make assumptions on the DGP of subseries spanning shorter time periods. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach with AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models using the real data application as well as numerical simulations. Our approach improves forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency in point forecasts and prediction intervals, especially for longer forecast horizons, compared to directly fitting the whole data with ARIMA models. Moreover, we explore some potential factors that may affect the forecasting performance of our approach.},

Safety management should not consider only single failures, but also the complex interactions in the system. This study applies task driven behavior theory and system theory to reveal a generic framework of the MRTS escalator accident mechanism and uses Lasso-Logistic Regression (LLR) for escalator injury prediction. Escalator accidents in the Beijing MRTS are used as a case study to estimate the applicability of the methodologies. The main results affirm that the application of System-Theoretical Process Analysis (STPA) and Task Driven Accident Process Analysis (TDAPA) to the generic escalator accident mechanism reveals non-failure state task driven passenger behaviors and constraints on safety that are not addressed in previous studies. The results also confirm that LLR is able to predict escalator accidents where there is a relatively large number of variables with limited observations. Additionally, increasing the amount of data improves the prediction accuracy for all three types of injuries in the case study, suggesting the LLR model has good extrapolation ability. The results can be applied in MRTS as instruments for both escalator accident investigation and accident prevention.},

  abstract = {Forecast combinations have flourished remarkably in the forecasting community and, in recent years, have become part of mainstream forecasting research and activities. Combining multiple forecasts produced for a target time series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby avoiding the need to identify a single “best” forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations of various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some crucial issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future research.},

  abstract = {The classical vector autoregressive model is a fundamental tool for multivariate time series analysis. However, it involves too many parameters when the number of time series and lag order are even moderately large. This article proposes to rearrange the transition matrices of the model into a tensor form such that the parameter space can be restricted along three directions simultaneously via tensor decomposition. In contrast, the reduced-rank regression method can restrict the parameter space in only one direction. Besides achieving substantial dimension reduction, the proposed model is interpretable from the factor modeling perspective. Moreover, to handle high-dimensional time series, this article considers imposing sparsity on factor matrices to improve the model interpretability and estimation efficiency, which leads to a sparsity-inducing estimator. For the low-dimensional case, we derive asymptotic properties of the proposed least squares estimator and introduce an alternating least squares algorithm. For the high-dimensional case, we establish nonasymptotic properties of the sparsity-inducing estimator and propose an ADMM algorithm for regularized estimation. Simulation experiments and a real data example demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over various existing methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The accurate estimation of the forecast uncertainty facilitates several operations management activities, predominantly in supporting decisions in inventory and supply chain management and effectively setting safety stocks. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based framework, which links the relationship between time series features and the interval forecasting performance into providing reliable interval forecasts. We propose an optimal threshold ratio searching algorithm and a new weight determination mechanism for selecting an appropriate subset of models and assigning combination weights for each time series tailored to the observed features. We evaluate our approach using a large set of time series from the M4 competition. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms a wide range of benchmark models, both in terms of point forecasts as well as prediction intervals.},

  abstract = {Distributed systems have been widely used in practice to accomplish data analysis tasks of huge scales. In this work, we target on the estimation problem of generalized linear models on a distributed system with nonrandomly distributed data. We develop a Pseudo-Newton-Raphson algorithm for efficient estimation. In this algorithm, we first obtain a pilot estimator based on a small random sample collected from different Workers. Then conduct one-step updating based on the computed derivatives of log-likelihood functions in each Worker at the pilot estimator. The final one-step estimator is proved to be statistically efficient as the global estimator, even with nonrandomly distributed data. In addition, it is computationally efficient, in terms of both communication cost and storage usage. Based on the one-step estimator, we also develop a likelihood ratio test for hypothesis testing. The theoretical properties of the one-step estimator and the corresponding likelihood ratio test are investigated. The finite sample performances are assessed through simulations. Finally, an American Airline dataset is analyzed on a Spark cluster for illustration purpose.},

  abstract = {In statistical inference, uncertainty is unknown and all models are wrong. That is to say, a person who makes a statistical model and a prior distribution is simultaneously aware that both are fictional candidates. To study such cases, statistical measures have been constructed, such as cross validation, information criteria and marginal likelihood; however, their mathematical properties have not yet been completely clarified when statistical models are under- or over-parametrized. We introduce a place of mathematical theory of Bayesian statistics for unknown uncertainty, which clarifies general properties of cross validation, information criteria and marginal likelihood, even if an unknown data-generating process is unrealizable by a model or even if the posterior distribution cannot be approximated by any normal distribution. Hence it gives a helpful standpoint for a person who cannot believe in any specific model and prior. This paper consists of three parts. The first is a new result, whereas the second and third are well-known previous results with new experiments. We show there exists a more precise estimator of the generalization loss than leave-one-out cross validation, there exists a more accurate approximation of marginal likelihood than Bayesian information criterion, and the optimal hyperparameters for generalization loss and marginal likelihood are different.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

The model is very flexible since both the noise-free signal and the noise variance are functions of diffusion covariates, and the relevant covariates in the noise are automatically selected by Bayesian variable selection. We compare the estimated diffusion tensors from our model to a homoscedastic counterpart with no covariates in the noise, and to commonly used linear and nonlinear least squares methods. The estimated single-diffusion tensors within each voxel are compared with respect to fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Using data from the Human Connectome Project, our results show that the noise is clearly heteroscedastic, especially the posterior variance for MD is substantially underestimated by the homoscedastic model, and inferences from the homoscedastic model are on average spuriously precise. Inferences from commonly used ordinary and weighted least squares methods (OLS and WLS) show that it is not adequate to estimate the single-diffusion tensor from logarithmic measurements.},

The Rician distribution is also relevant for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained at high temporal or spatial resolution. We propose a general regression model for non-central χ (NC-χ ) distributed data, with the heteroscedastic Rician regression model as a prominent special case. The model allows both parameters in the Rician distribution to be linked to explanatory variables, with the relevant variables chosen by Bayesian variable selection. A highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to capture full model uncertainty by simulating from the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters and the binary variable selection indicators. Simulated regression data is used to demonstrate that the Rician model is able to detect the signal much more accurately than the traditionally used Gaussian model at low signal-to-noise ratios. Using a diffusion dataset from the Human Connectome Project, it is also shown that the commonly used approximate Gaussian noise model underestimates the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the single-diffusion tensor model compared to the Rician model.},

A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to make probabilistic projections of the 39,800 bilateral migration flows among the 200 most populous countries. We generate out-of-sample forecasts for all bilateral flows for the 2015 to 2020 period, using models fitted to bilateral migration flows for five 5-y periods from 1990 to 1995 through 2010 to 2015. We find that the model produces well-calibrated out-of-sample forecasts of bilateral flows, as well as total country-level inflows, outflows, and net flows. The mean absolute error decreased by 61\% using our method, compared to a leading model of international migration. Out-of-sample analysis indicated that simple methods for forecasting migration flows offered accurate projections of bilateral migration flows in the near term. Our method matched or improved on the out-of-sample performance using these simple deterministic alternatives, while also accurately assessing uncertainty. We integrate the migration flow forecasting model into a fully probabilistic population projection model to generate bilateral migration flow forecasts by age and sex for all flows from 2020 to 2025 through 2040 to 2045.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian decision analysis perspective on problems of constrained forecasting is presented and developed, motivated by increasing interest in problems of aggregate and hierarchical forecasting coupled with short-comings of traditional, purely inferential approaches. Foundational and pedagogic developments underlie new methodological approaches to such problems, explored and exemplified in contexts of total-constrained forecasting linked to motivating applications in commercial forecasting. The new perspective is complementary and integrated with traditional Bayesian inference approaches, while offering new practical methodology when the traditional view is challenged. Examples explore ranges of practically relevant loss functions in simple, illustrative contexts that highlight the opportunities for methodology as well as practically important questions of how constrained forecasting is impacted by dependencies among outcomes being predicted. The paper couples this core development with arguments in support of a broader view of Bayesian decision analysis than is typically adopted, involving studies of predictive distributions of loss function values under putative optimal decisions. Additional examples highlight the practical importance of this broader view in the constrained forecasting context. Extensions to more general constrained forecasting problems, and connections with broader interests in forecast reconciliation and aggregation are noted along with other broader considerations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes methods for estimation and inference in multivariate, multi-quantile models. The theory can simultaneously accommodate models with multiple random variables, multiple confidence levels, and multiple lags of the associated quantiles. The proposed framework can be conveniently thought of as a vector autoregressive (VAR) extension to quantile models. We estimate a simple version of the model using market equity returns data to analyze spillovers in the values at risk (VaR) between a market index and financial institutions. We construct impulse-response functions for the quantiles of a sample of 230 financial institutions around the world and study how financial institution-specific and system-wide shocks are absorbed by the system. We show how the long-run risk of the largest and most leveraged financial institutions is very sensitive to market wide shocks in situations of financial distress, suggesting that our methodology can prove a valuable addition to the traditional toolkit of policy makers and supervisors.},

  abstract = {To find the best forecasting model, several methods are usually tried on training dataset and the best one is selected to forecast the testing dataset. In this paper, we propose a model which selects a forecasting method based on its previous performance on similar dataset assuming that we have historical database of predictor’s performance. Thus, we need to obtain the characteristics of time series for similarity measure. Since not all of time series characteristics may necessarily be used to identify certain time series, we reduce the dimensionality of those characteristics using Principal Component Analysis. We use diverse forecasting methods ranging from simple to sophisticated ones, measure as Random Walk, ARIMA, interpolation, S-curve, and Multiple Kernel Learning. To cope with large dataset, we utilize clustering and similarity measure to select only a subset of training dataset. We use the 3003 dataset from M3 competition to construct the historical database which acts as training dataset and 111 from the M1 competition as testing dataset. Our experimental results indicate that our model selection may perform well compared to each individual predictor. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to select suitable predictors without trying all of them on current dataset.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are single-celled organisms which often display heterogeneous behaviour, even among populations of genetically identical cells in uniform environmental conditions. Markov process models arising from the theory of stochastic chemical kinetics are often used to understand the genetic regulation of the behaviour of individual bacterial cells. However, such models often contain uncertain parameters which need to be estimated from experimental data. Parameter estimation for complex high-dimensional Markov process models using diverse, partial, noisy and poorly calibrated time-course experimental data is a challenging inferential problem, but a computationally intensive Bayesian approach turns out to be effective. The utility and addedvalue of the approach is demonstrated in the context of a stochastic model of a key cellular decision made by the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, using quantitative data from single-cell fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry experiments.},

  abstract = {A mixture vector autoregressive model has recently been introduced to the literature. Although this model is a promising candidate for nonlinear multiple time series modeling, high dimensionality of the parameters and lack of method for computing the standard errors of estimates limit its application to real data. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a form of parameter constraints is introduced with an efficient EM algorithm for estimation. Second, an accurate method for computing standard errors is presented for the model with and without parameter constraints. Lastly, a hypothesis-testing approach based on likelihood ratio tests is proposed, which aids in the selection of unnecessary parameters and leads to the greater efficiency at the estimation. A case study employing U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates illustrates the applicability of the mixture vector autoregressive model with parameter constraints, and the importance of using a reliable method to compute standard errors.},

This makes the material easier to understand and, ultimately, leads to better econometric practices. Packed with relevant applications, the text incorporates more than 100 data sets in different formats.

This optimization aims at the unification of segment finding and edge detection. The optimized split-and-merge algorithm is shown to be adaptive to the image semantics and, hence, improves the segmentation validity of the previous algorithms. The new algorithm also appeared to work well on noisy sources. Since the optimization is done within the split-and-merge framework, the better segmentation performance is achieved at the same order of time complexity as the previous algorithms.},

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy. We also find that curtailing intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers have become standard algorithms for MCMC implementations, as opposed to more basic versions, but they still require some amount of tuning and calibration. Exploiting the U-turn criterion of the NUTS algorithm (Hoffman and Gelman, 2014), we propose a version of HMC that relies on the distribution of the integration time of the associated leapfrog integrator. Using in addition the primal-dual averaging method for tuning the step size of the integrator, we achieve an essentially calibration free version of HMC. When compared with the original NUTS on several benchmarks, this algorithm exhibits a significantly improved efficiency.},

  abstract = {It is common but challenging to address high-resolution image blending in the automatic photo editing application. In this paper, we would like to focus on solving the problem of high-resolution image blending, where the composite images are provided. We propose a framework called Gaussian-Poisson Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) to leverage the strengths of the classical gradient-based approach and Generative Adversarial Networks. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that explores the capability of GANs in high-resolution image blending task. Concretely, we propose Gaussian-Poisson Equation to formulate the high-resolution image blending problem, which is a joint optimization constrained by the gradient and color information. Inspired by the prior works, we obtain gradient information via applying gradient filters. To generate the color information, we propose a Blending GAN to learn the mapping between the composite images and the well-blended ones. Compared to the alternative methods, our approach can deliver high-resolution, realistic images with fewer bleedings and unpleasant artifacts. Experiments confirm that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Transient Attributes dataset. A user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk finds that the majority of workers are in favor of the proposed method.},

In this work, we focus on the variable selection aspect of penalized quantile regression. Under some mild conditions, we demonstrate the oracle properties of the SCAD and adaptive-LASSO penalized quantile regressions. For the SCAD penalty, despite its good asymptotic properties, the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex and as a result much harder to solve. In this work, we take advantage of the decomposition of the SCAD penalty function as the difference of two convex functions and propose to solve the corresponding optimization using the Difference Convex Algorithm (DCA).},

Although there is overwhelming empirical evidence in the literature showing its success, there is relatively little research exploring why the reparameterization trick is so effective. We explore this under the idealized assumptions that the variational approximation is a meanfield Gaussian density and that the log of the joint density of the model parameters and the data is a quadratic function that depends on the variational mean. From this, we show that the marginal variances of the reparameterization gradient estimator are smaller than those of the score function gradient estimator. We apply the result of our idealized analysis to real-world examples.},

In this paper, we propose Bayesian convex and linear aggregation approaches motivated by regression applications. We show that the proposed approach is minimax optimal when the true data-generating model is a convex or linear combination of models in the list. Moreover, the method can adapt to sparsity structure in which certain models should receive zero weights, and the method is tuning parameter free unlike competitors. More generally, under an Mopen view when the truth falls outside the space of all convex/linear combinations, our theory suggests that the posterior measure tends to concentrate on the best approximation of the truth at the minimax rate. We illustrate the method through simulation studies and several applications.},

While it has long been noted to produce spuriously high posterior probabilities for trees or clades, the precise reasons for this overconfidence are unknown. Here we characterize the behavior of Bayesian model selection when the compared models are misspecified and demonstrate that when the models are nearly equally wrong, the method exhibits unpleasant polarized behaviors, supporting one model with high confidence while rejecting others. This provides an explanation for the empirical observation of spuriously high posterior probabilities in molecular phylogenetics.           ,              The Bayesian method is noted to produce spuriously high posterior probabilities for phylogenetic trees in analysis of large datasets, but the precise reasons for this overconfidence are unknown. In general, the performance of Bayesian selection of misspecified models is poorly understood, even though this is of great scientific interest since models are never true in real data analysis. Here we characterize the asymptotic behavior of Bayesian model selection and show that when the competing models are equally wrong, Bayesian model selection exhibits surprising and polarized behaviors in large datasets, supporting one model with full force while rejecting the others. If one model is slightly less wrong than the other, the less wrong model will eventually win when the amount of data increases, but the method may become overconfident before it becomes reliable. We suggest that this extreme behavior may be a major factor for the spuriously high posterior probabilities for evolutionary trees. The philosophical implications of our results to the application of Bayesian model selection to evaluate opposing scientific hypotheses are yet to be explored, as are the behaviors of non-Bayesian methods in similar situations.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a prevailing distributed learning paradigm, where a large number of workers jointly learn a model without sharing their training data. However, high communication costs could arise in FL due to large-scale (deep) learning models and bandwidth-constrained connections. In this paper, we introduce a communication-efficient algorithmic framework called CFedAvg for FL with non-i.i.d. datasets, which works with general (biased or unbiased) SNR-constrained compressors. We analyze the convergence rate of CFedAvg for non-convex functions with constant and decaying learning rates. The CFedAvg algorithm can achieve an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(1 / \textbackslash sqrt\{mKT\} + 1 / T)\$ convergence rate with a constant learning rate, implying a linear speedup for convergence as the number of workers increases, where \$K\$ is the number of local steps, \$T\$ is the number of total communication rounds, and \$m\$ is the total worker number. This matches the convergence rate of distributed/federated learning without compression, thus achieving high communication efficiency while not sacrificing learning accuracy in FL. Furthermore, we extend CFedAvg to cases with heterogeneous local steps, which allows different workers to perform a different number of local steps to better adapt to their own circumstances. The interesting observation in general is that the noise/variance introduced by compressors does not affect the overall convergence rate order for non-i.i.d. FL. We verify the effectiveness of our CFedAvg algorithm on three datasets with two gradient compression schemes of different compression ratios.},

  abstract = {Spare parts inventory management is complex due to the combined impact of intermittent and variable demand patterns. It becomes even more challenging if the spare parts demand distribution is highly complex due to strong interdependent demand intermittency and extremely irregular demand. The research literature proposes many analytical methods for forecasting spare parts demand. But, due to their limited flexibility in modeling complex demand patterns, existing forecasting methods may not produce satisfactory results for a spare parts portfolio displaying extremely complex demand patterns. This study proposes a novel nonparametric Bayesian forecasting approach with its roots in the empirical Bayes paradigm. The method is subject to few performance constraints and is highly flexible in dealing with a rich diversity of demand patterns, including extreme demand complexity. We assess the relative performance of this new approach with several prominent methods in the literature using an automotive parts distributor's empirical demand data for 46,272 stock-keeping units. This dataset is representative of typical spare parts portfolios that are characterized by a wide variety and extremely complex demand patterns. The experimental findings show the new Bayesian approach achieves the best overall performance in terms of inventory efficiency and minimal backorders for meeting specified target service levels. This favorable performance reflects the approach's flexibility to accommodate disparate and complex demand patterns, including interdependence of demand intermittency, irregular demand distribution, and even nonstationary demand distribution to some extent, and provide robust solutions.},

Deep forecasting models, however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the notion of such perturbations, together with that of robustness, has not even been completely established in the regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for robust probabilistic time series forecasting. First, we generalize the concept of adversarial input perturbations, based on which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms of bounded Wasserstein deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique to attain robust probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates against certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the forecast quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency under supplement of noisy observations.},

The coefficients are estimated in the context of M-estimation. It is known that ordinary M-estimation leads to overfitting in nonlinear regression. The purpose of this paper is to construct a smooth estimator. The proposed method in this paper is conducted by a two-step procedure. First, the sufficient dimension reduction methods are applied to the response and radial basis functions for transforming the large number of radial bases to a small number of linear combinations of the radial bases without loss of information. In the second step, a multiple linear regression model between a response and the transformed radial bases is assumed and the ordinary Mestimation is applied. Thus, the final estimator is also obtained as a linear combination of radial bases. The validity and an asymptotic study of the proposed method are explored. A simulation and data example are addressed to confirm the behavior of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Melody generation from lyrics has been a challenging research issue in the field of artificial intelligence and music, which enables to learn and discover latent relationship between interesting lyrics and accompanying melody. Unfortunately, the limited availability of paired lyrics-melody dataset with alignment information has hindered the research progress. To address this problem, we create a large dataset consisting of 12,197 MIDI songs each with paired lyrics and melody alignment through leveraging different music sources where alignment relationship between syllables and music attributes is extracted. Most importantly, we propose a novel deep generative model, conditional Long Short-Term Memory - Generative Adversarial Network (LSTM-GAN) for melody generation from lyrics, which contains a deep LSTM generator and a deep LSTM discriminator both conditioned on lyrics. In particular, lyrics-conditioned melody and alignment relationship between syllables of given lyrics and notes of predicted melody are generated simultaneously. Experimental results have proved the effectiveness of our proposed lyrics-to-melody generative model, where plausible and tuneful sequences can be inferred from lyrics.},

In this paper, to reduce the communication complexity, we propose double quantization, a general scheme for quantizing both model parameters and gradients. Three communication-efficient algorithms are proposed based on this general scheme. Specifically, (i) we propose a low-precision algorithm AsyLPG with asynchronous parallelism, (ii) we explore integrating gradient sparsification with double quantization and develop Sparse-AsyLPG, (iii) we show that double quantization can be accelerated by the momentum technique and design accelerated AsyLPG. We establish rigorous performance guarantees for the algorithms, and conduct experiments on a multi-server test-bed with real-world datasets to demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively save transmitted bits without performance degradation, and significantly outperform existing methods with either model parameter or gradient quantization.},

  abstract = {We describe matrix computations available in the cluster programming framework, Apache Spark. Out of the box, Spark provides abstractions and implementations for distributed matrices and optimization routines using these matrices. When translating single-node algorithms to run on a distributed cluster, we observe that often a simple idea is enough: separating matrix operations from vector operations and shipping the matrix operations to be ran on the cluster, while keeping vector operations local to the driver. In the case of the Singular Value Decomposition, by taking this idea to an extreme, we are able to exploit the computational power of a cluster, while running code written decades ago for a single core. Another example is our Spark port of the popular TFOCS optimization package, originally built for MATLAB, which allows for solving Linear programs as well as a variety of other convex programs. We conclude with a comprehensive set of benchmarks for hardware accelerated matrix computations from the JVM, which is interesting in its own right, as many cluster programming frameworks use the JVM. The contributions described in this paper are already merged into Apache Spark and available on Spark installations by default, and commercially supported by a slew of companies which provide further services.},

  abstract = {Today, a myriad data sources, from the Internet to business operations to scientific instruments, produce large and valuable data streams. However, the processing capabilities of single machines have not kept up with the size of data. As a result, organizations increasingly need to scale out these computations to clusters of hundreds of machines. At the same time, the speed and sophistication required of data processing have grown. In addition to simple queries, complex algorithms like machine learning and graph analysis are becoming common. And in addition to batch processing, streaming analysis of real-time data is required to let organizations take timely action. Future computing platforms will need to not only scale out traditional workloads, but support these new applications too. This book, a revised version of the 2014 ACM Dissertation Award winning dissertation, proposes an architecture for cluster computing systems that can tackle emerging data processing workloads at scale. Whereas early cluster computing systems, like MapReduce, handled batch processing, our architecture also enables streaming and interactive queries, while keeping MapReduce's scalability and fault tolerance. And whereas most deployed systems only support simple one-pass computations (e.g., SQL queries), ours also extends to the multi-pass algorithms required for complex analytics like machine learning. Finally, unlike the specialized systems proposed for some of these workloads, our architecture allows these computations to be combined, enabling rich new applications that intermix, for example, streaming and batch processing. We achieve these results through a simple extension to MapReduce that adds primitives for data sharing, called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). We show that this is enough to capture a wide range of workloads. We implement RDDs in the open source Spark system, which we evaluate using synthetic and real workloads. Spark matches or exceeds the performance of specialized systems in many domains, while offering stronger fault tolerance properties and allowing these workloads to be combined. Finally, we examine the generality of RDDs from both a theoretical modeling perspective and a systems perspective. This version of the dissertation makes corrections throughout the text and adds a new section on the evolution of Apache Spark in industry since 2014. In addition, editing, formatting, drawing of illustrations, and links for the references have been added.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of methodological results to design efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for statistical models with discrete-valued high-dimensional parameters. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a simple framework for the design of informed MCMC proposals (i.e. Metropolis-Hastings proposal distributions that appropriately incorporate local information about the target) which is naturally applicable to both discrete and continuous spaces. We explicitly characterize the class of optimal proposal distributions under this framework, which we refer to as locallybalanced proposals, and prove their Peskun-optimality in high-dimensional regimes. The resulting algorithms are straightforward to implement in discrete spaces and provide orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency compared to alternative MCMC schemes, including discrete versions of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Simulations are performed with both simulated and real datasets, including a detailed application to Bayesian record linkage. A direct connection with gradient-based MCMC suggests that locally-balanced proposals may be seen as a natural way to extend the latter to discrete spaces.},

The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L1 penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm.

  abstract = {We analyze two communication-efficient algorithms for distributed optimization in statistical settings involving large-scale data sets. The first algorithm is a standard averaging method that distributes the N data samples evenly to m machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error (MSE) that decays as O(N-1 +(N/m)-2). Whenever m ≤ √N, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of bootstrap subsampling. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as O(N-1 + (N/m)-3), and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. In addition, we show that a stochastic gradient-based method attains mean-squared error decaying as O(N-1 + (N/m)-3/2), easing computation at the expense of a potentially slower MSE rate. We also provide an experimental evaluation of our methods, investigating their performance both on simulated data and on a large-scale regression problem from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods can be used to efficiently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which involves logistic regression with N ≈ 2.4×108 samples and d ≈ 740,000 covariates.},

We assume multivariate normal linear regression models for multivariate continuous measures, multivariate probit models for correlated ordinal measures, and multivariate multinomial probit models for multivariate categorical/nominal measures. Then we assume a multivariate normal linear model on the continuous vector comprised of continuous variables and those underlying normal variables for ordinal variables from multivariate probit models and for categorical variables from multinomial probit models. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate unknown parameters including regression parameters, cut-points for ordinal data from the multivariate probit models, and the covariance matrix encompassing both continuous variables and the underlying normal latent variables. Combining the continuous variables and the normal latent variables allows us to model combinations of continuous, ordinal, and categorical multivariate data simultaneously. The framework incorporates flexible priors for the covariance matrix, provides a foundation for inference about the underlying covariance structure, and imputes missing data where needed. The method is illustrated through simulated examples and two real data applications.},

In this paper, we show that the slow rate is intrinsic to a broad class of M-estimators. In particular, for estimators based on minimizing a least-squares cost function together with a (possibly non-convex) coordinate-wise separable regularizer, there is always a “bad” local√optimum such that the associated prediction error is lower bounded by a constant multiple of 1/ n. For convex regularizers, this lower bound applies to all global optima. The theory is applicable to many popular estimators, including convex ℓ1-based methods as well as M-estimators based on nonconvex regularizers, including the SCAD penalty or the MCP regularizer. In addition, for a broad class of nonconvex regularizers, we show that the bad local optima are very common, in that a broad class of local minimization algorithms with random initialization will typically converge to a bad solution.},

Samples generated by existing textto-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256×256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.},

  abstract = {With high-dimensional data emerging in various domains, sparse logistic regression models have gained much interest of researchers. Variable selection plays a key role in both improving the prediction accuracy and enhancing the interpretability of built models. Bayesian variable selection approaches enjoy many advantages such as high selection accuracy, easily incorporating many kinds of prior knowledge and so on. Because Bayesian methods generally make inference from the posterior distribution with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, however, they become intractable in high-dimensional situations due to the large searching space. To address this issue, a novel variational Bayesian method for variable selection in high-dimensional logistic regression models is presented. The proposed method is based on the indicator model in which each covariate is equipped with a binary latent variable indicating whether it is important. The Bernoullitype prior is adopted for the latent indicator variable. As for the specification of the hyperparameter in the Bernoulli prior, we provide two schemes to determine its optimal value so that the novel model can achieve sparsity adaptively. To identify important variables and make predictions, one efficient variational Bayesian approach is employed to make inference from the posterior distribution. The experiments conducted with both synthetic and some publicly available data show that the new method outperforms or is very competitive with some other popular counterparts.},

While transformers[1] have achieved outstanding performances in time series forecasting, they often require many training samples due the large number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose a training technique for transformers that prepares the training windows through random sampling. As input time steps need not to be consecutive, the number of distinct samples increases from linearly to combinatorially many. By breaking the temporal order, this technique also helps transformers to capture dependencies among time steps in finer granularity.

  abstract = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to address the problem of single image de-raining. However, the inherent ill-posed nature of the problem presents several challenges. We attempt to leverage powerful generative modeling capabilities of the recently introduced Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) by enforcing an additional constraint that the de-rained image must be indistinguishable from its corresponding ground truth clean image. The adversarial loss from GAN provides additional regularization and helps to achieve superior results. In addition to presenting a new approach to de-rain images, we introduce a new refined loss function and architectural novelties in the generator-discriminator pair for achieving improved results. The loss function is aimed at reducing artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality. The generator sub-network is constructed using the recently introduced densely connected networks, whereas the discriminator is designed to leverage global and local information to decide if an image is real/fake. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance. Furthermore, experimental results evaluated on object detection datasets using FasterRCNN also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method in improving the detection performance on images degraded by rain.},

  abstract = {Advances in information technology have led to extremely large datasets that are often kept in different storage centers. Existing statistical methods must be adapted to overcome the resulting computational obstacles while retaining statistical validity and efficiency. In this situation, the split-and-conquer strategy is among the most effective solutions to many statistical problems, including quantile processes, regression analysis, principal eigenspaces, and exponential families. This paper applies this strategy to develop a distributed learning procedure of finite Gaussian mixtures. We recommend a reduction strategy and invent an effective majorization-minimization algorithm. The new estimator is consistent and retains root-n consistency under some general conditions. Experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed estimator has comparable statistical performance with the global estimator based on the full dataset, if the latter is feasible. It can even outperform the global estimator for the purpose of clustering if the model assumption does not fully match the real-world data. It also has better statistical and computational performance than some existing split-and-conquer approaches.},

  abstract = {While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) unfortunately limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss and classification loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17\%.},

In particular, it is not uncommon to have extremely unbalanced data with excessively large proportion of zero claims, and even traditional Tweedie model may not be satisfactory for fitting the data. In this paper, we propose a boosting-assisted zero-inflated Tweedie model, called EMTboost, that allows zero probability mass to exceed a traditional model. We makes a nonparametric assumption on its Tweedie model component, that unlike a linear model, is able to capture nonlinearities, discontinuities, and complex higher order interactions among predictors. A specialized Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed that integrates a blockwise coordinate descent strategy and a gradient tree-boosting algorithm to estimate key model parameters. We use extensive simulation and data analysis on synthetic zero-inflated auto-insurance claim data to illustrate our method’s prediction performance.},

However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of substantially complicating the process of drawing inferences from the model. In particular, inference can become challenging when the support of the model varies between executions. Though general-purpose inference engines have been designed to operate in such settings, they are typically highly inefficient, often relying on proposing from the prior to make transitions. To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine (DCC). DCC divides the program into separate straight-line sub-programs, each of which has a fixed support allowing more powerful inference algorithms to be run locally, before recombining their outputs in a principled fashion. We show how DCC can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine, and empirically confirm that it can provide substantial performance improvements over previous approaches.},

When the dimension diverges at the rate of o( n), the asymptotic efficiency of the global maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the one-step MLE, and the aggregated estimating equation (AEE) estimator for GLMs are established.

The hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting includes two sub-tasks, i.e., forecasting and reconciliation. In the previous works, hierarchical information is only integrated in the reconciliation step to maintain coherency, but not in forecasting step for accuracy improvement. In this paper, we propose two novel tree-based feature integration mechanisms, i.e., top-down convolution and bottom-up attention to leverage the information of the hierarchical structure to improve the forecasting performance. Moreover, unlike most previous reconciliation methods which either rely on strong assumptions or focus on coherent constraints only,we utilize deep neural optimization networks, which not only achieve coherency without any assumptions, but also allow more flexible and realistic constraints to achieve task-based targets, e.g., lower under-estimation penalty and meaningful decision-making loss to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our tree-based feature integration mechanism achieves superior performances on hierarchical forecasting tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and our neural optimization networks can be applied to real-world tasks effectively without any additional effort under coherence and task-based constraints},

However, a fundamental limitation of HMC is that it can not be applied to distributions with mixed discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose mixed HMC (MHMC) as a general framework to address this limitation. M-HMC is a novel family of MCMC algorithms that evolves the discrete and continuous variables in tandem, allowing more frequent updates of discrete variables while maintaining HMC’s ability to suppress random-walk behavior. We establish M-HMC’s theoretical properties, and present an efficient implementation with Laplace momentum that introduces minimal overhead compared to existing HMC methods. The superior performances of M-HMC over existing methods are demonstrated with numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), variable selection in Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), and correlated topic models (CTMs).},

However, batch-based DRL algorithms cannot guarantee the non-decreasing property of learned quantile curves especially at the early training stage, leading to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce a general DRL framework by using non-crossing quantile regression to ensure the monotonicity constraint within each sampled batch, which can be incorporated with some well-known DRL algorithm. We demonstrate the validity of our method from both the theory and model implementation perspectives. Experiments on Atari 2600 Games show that some state-of-art DRL algorithms with the non-crossing modification can significantly outperform their baselines in terms of faster convergence speeds and better testing performance. In particular, our method can effectively recover the distribution information and thus dramatically increase the exploration efficiency when the reward space is extremely sparse.},

The model is implemented using an AR (p)-GARCH (1, 1)-t model for the marginal distributions and constant and time-varying copulas for the joint distribution. The results show that the dependence between crude oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock market returns is generally weak, that it was positive before the global financial crisis, except in Hong Kong, and that it increased significantly in the aftermath of the crisis. The lower tail dependence between oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock markets exceeds that of the upper tail dependence, except in Japan and Singapore in the post-crisis period. Moreover, we show that time-varying copulas best capture the tail dependence and that taking the tail correlation into account leads to improved accuracy of VaR estimates. These findings have important implications for investors interested in Asia-Pacific markets for portfolio diversification, risk management, and international asset allocation.},

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to enforce F (G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

Finite-sample bounds on forecasting performance that account for estimation error are used to compute the expected loss of the competing forecasts as well as for the dynamic rotation strategy. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications to forecasting inflation and stock returns, we demonstrate the potential gains from using conditioning information to rotate between forecasts.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a distributed least-square approximation (DLSA) method that is able to solve a large family of regression problems (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox’s model) on a distributed system. By approximating the local objective function using a local quadratic form, we are able to obtain a combined estimator by taking a weighted average of local estimators. The resulting estimator is proved to be statistically as efficient as the global estimator. Moreover, it requires only one round of communication. We further conduct a shrinkage estimation based on the DLSA estimation using an adaptive Lasso approach. The solution can be easily obtained by using the LARS algorithm on the master node. It is theoretically shown that the resulting estimator possesses the oracle property and is selection consistent by using a newly designed distributed Bayesian information criterion. The finite sample performance and computational efficiency are further illustrated by an extensive numerical study and an airline dataset. The airline dataset is 52 GB in size. The entire methodology has been implemented in Python for a de-facto standard Spark system. The proposed DLSA algorithm on the Spark system takes 26 min to obtain a logistic regression estimator, which is more efficient and memory friendly than conventional methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In this work, we develop a subsampling approach for feature screening with massive datasets. The approach is implemented by repeated subsampling of massive data and can be used for analyzing tasks with memory constraints. To conduct the procedure, we first calculate an R-squared screening measure (and related sample moments) based on subsamples. Second, we consider three methods to combine the local statistics. In addition to the simple average method, we design a jackknife debiased screening measure and an aggregated moment screening measure. Both approaches reduce the bias of the subsampling screening measure and therefore increase the accuracy of the feature screening. Last, we consider a novel sequential sampling method, that is more computationally efficient than the traditional random sampling method. The theoretical properties of the three screening measures under both sampling schemes are rigorously discussed. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method with an airline dataset containing 32.7 million records.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix factorization is a problem of broad importance, owing to the ubiquity of low-rank models in machine learning contexts. In spite of its nonconvexity, this problem has a well-behaved geometric landscape, permitting local search algorithms such as gradient descent to converge to global minimizers. In this paper, we study low-rank matrix factorization in the distributed setting, where local variables at each node encode parts of the overall matrix factors, and consensus is encouraged among certain such variables. We identify conditions under which this new problem also has a well-behaved geometric landscape, and we propose an extension of distributed gradient descent (DGD) to solve this problem. The favorable landscape allows us to prove convergence to global optimality with exact consensus, a stronger result than what is provided by off-the-shelf DGD theory.},

Unknown parameters in the forecast combination are optimized according to criterion functions based on proper scoring rules, which are chosen to reward the form of forecast accuracy that matters for the problem at hand, and forecast performance is measured using the out-of-sample expectation of said scoring rule. Our results provide novel insights into the behavior of estimated forecast combinations. Firstly, we show that, asymptotically, the sampling variability in the performance of standard forecast combinations is determined solely by estimation of the constituent models, with estimation of the combination weights contributing no sampling variability whatsoever, at first order. Secondly, we show that, if computationally feasible, forecast combinations produced in a single step – in which the constituent model and combination function parameters are estimated jointly – have superior predictive accuracy and lower sampling variability than standard forecast combinations – where constituent model and combination function parameters are estimated in two steps. These theoretical insights are demonstrated numerically, both in simulation settings and in an extensive empirical illustration using a time series of S\&P500 returns.},

For the last several years Bayesian statistical methods have been proposed and used. Bayesian approaches are ideal for earlier phase trials as they take into account information that accrues during a trial. Predictive probabilities are then updated and so become more accurate as the trial progresses. Suitable priors can act as pseudo samples, which make small sample clinical trials more informative. Thus patients have better chances to receive better treatments. The goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial for statisticians who use Bayesian methods for the first time or investigators who have some statistical background. In addition, real data from three clinical trials are presented as examples to illustrate how to conduct a Bayesian approach for phase II single-arm clinical trials with binary outcomes.},
