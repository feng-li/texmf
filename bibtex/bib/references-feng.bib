  abstract = {The semi-open character with high passenger flow in Metro Rail Transport Stations (MRTS) makes safety management of human-electromechanical interaction escalator systems more complex. Safety management should not consider only single failures, but also the complex interactions in the system. This study applies task driven behavior theory and system theory to reveal a generic framework of the MRTS escalator accident mechanism and uses Lasso-Logistic Regression (LLR) for escalator injury prediction. Escalator accidents in the Beijing MRTS are used as a case study to estimate the applicability of the methodologies. The main results affirm that the application of System-Theoretical Process Analysis (STPA) and Task Driven Accident Process Analysis (TDAPA) to the generic escalator accident mechanism reveals non-failure state task driven passenger behaviors and constraints on safety that are not addressed in previous studies. The results also confirm that LLR is able to predict escalator accidents where there is a relatively large number of variables with limited observations. Additionally, increasing the amount of data improves the prediction accuracy for all three types of injuries in the case study, suggesting the LLR model has good extrapolation ability. The results can be applied in MRTS as instruments for both escalator accident investigation and accident prevention.},

  abstract = {Hospitalized self-inflicted firearm injuries have not been extensively studied, particularly regarding clinical diagnoses at the index admission. The objective of this study was to discover the diagnostic phenotypes (DPs) or clusters of hospitalized self-inflicted firearm injuries. Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data in the US from 1993 to 2014, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to identify self-inflicted firearm injuries among those ≥18 years of age. The 25 most frequent diagnostic codes were used to compute a dissimilarity matrix and the optimal number of clusters. We used hierarchical clustering to identify the main DPs. The overall cohort included 14072 hospitalizations, with self-inflicted firearm injuries occurring mainly in those between 16 to 45 years of age, black, with co-occurring tobacco and alcohol use, and mental illness. Out of the three identified DPs, DP1 was the largest (n=10,110), and included most common diagnoses similar to overall cohort, including major depressive disorders (27.7\%), hypertension (16.8\%), acute post hemorrhagic anemia (16.7\%), tobacco (15.7\%) and alcohol use (12.6\%). DP2 (n=3,725) was not characterized by any of the top 25 ICD-9 diagnoses codes, and included children and peripartum women. DP3, the smallest phenotype (n=237), had high prevalence of depression similar to DP1, and defined by fewer fatal injuries of chest and abdomen. There were three distinct diagnostic phenotypes in hospitalizations due to self-inflicted firearm injuries. Further research is needed to determine how DPs can be used to tailor clinical care and prevention efforts.},

The first effect has a direct influence on the response variable, whereas the second latent effect is assumed to first influence other latent variables, which in turn affect the response variable. In this article, latent variables are modelled via rank restrictions on unknown mean parameters and the models which are used are often referred to as reduced rank regression models. This article presents a likelihood-based approach that results in explicit estimators. In our model, the latent variables act as covariates that we know exist, but their direct influence is unknown and will therefore not be considered in detail. One example is if we observe hundreds of weather variables, but we cannot say which or how these variables affect plant growth.},

This result supports the recent evidence and provides principles for the design of new algorithms.•In an extensive empirical study, we show that purposely naïve algorithms derived from these principles show outstanding accuracy. In particular, global linear models provide competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters than the simplest of local methods.},

  abstract = {Quantile regression, which analyzes the conditional distribution of outcomes given a set of covariates, has been widely used in many fields. However, the volume and velocity of big data make the estimation of quantile regression model extremely difficult due to the intensive computation and the limited storage. Based on divide and conquer strategy, a simple and efficient method is proposed to address this problem. The proposed approach only keeps summary statistics of each data block and then can use them to reconstruct the estimator of the entire data with asymptotically negligible approximation error. This property makes the proposed method particularly appealing when data blocks are retained in multiple servers or come in the form of data stream. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically as efficient as the estimating equation estimator calculated using the entire data together when certain conditions hold. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated using both simulation studies and real data analysis.},

This fact is illustrated with a special case of filtered 2SLSspecifically, the forward orthogonal deviations (FOD) transformation. If a restriction on the instruments is satisfied, GMM based on the FOD transformation (FOD-GMM) is identical to GMM based on the more popular first-difference (FD) transformation (FD-GMM). However, the FOD transformation provides significant reductions in computing time when the length of the time series (T) is not small. If the instruments condition is not met, the FD and FOD transformations lead to different GMM estimators. In this case, the computational advantage of the FOD transformation over the FD transformation is not as dramatic. On the other hand, in this case, Monte Carlo evidence provided in the paper indicates that FOD-GMM has better sampling properties-smaller absolute bias and standard deviations. Moreover, if T is not small, the FOD-GMM estimator has better sampling properties than the FD-GMM estimator even when the latter estimator is based on the optimal weighting matrix. Hence, when T is not small, FOD-GMM dominates FD-GMM in terms of both computational efficiency and sampling performance.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the problem of default correlation. We first introduce a random variable called "timeuntil-default" to denote the survival time of each defaultable entity or financial instrument, and define the default correlation between two credit risks as the correlation coefficient between their survival times. Then we argue why a copula function approach should be used to specify the joint distribution of survival times after marginal distributions of survival times are derived from market information, such as risky bond prices or asset swap spreads. The definition and some basic properties of copula functions are given. We show that the current CreditMetrics approach to default correlation through asset correlation is equivalent to using a normal copula function. Finally, we give some numerical examples to illustrate the use of copula functions in the valuation of some credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and first-to-default contracts.}

  abstract = {Families of copulas could be distinguished according to the allocation of the weight among the dependence structure: some copulas could stress more on upper tails (large claims, while other could stress more on lower tails...etc. As mentioned by Gary Venter in Tails of Copulas in property and casualty applications, there could be interest in copulas that emphasize correlation among large losses. More precisely, it might be more interesting to focus on the upper tail, to be sure that the model fits well the dependence among large losses -the main idea being that we should chose a copula which does not underestimate the dependence in the upper tail. In this paper, we will study (in Part 2) conditional copula, which is the copula of the distribution (X,Y), given X and Y both higher, or lower, than a given threshold (defined as a quantile, for a given risk level). After defining these conditional properties, we will give some properties, satisfied by these families of copulas, focusing on a stable family: the family of Archimedian copula. This conditional copula will be used, then (in Part 3), to define a functional dependence measure, based on Spearman ’s rho, call tail rank correlation, which could be seen as a measure of dependence in the tails of the distribution.},

  abstract = {Accurate forecasts are vital for supporting the decisions of modern companies. Forecasters typically select the most appropriate statistical model for each time series. However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach — ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction intervals.},

  abstract = {This standard textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition, combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with proofs given in full detail.   The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for self-study.   From the reviews: “This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory.” Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum~“Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book about the heart of graph theory. It hasdepth and integrity.” Persi Diaconis \& Ron Graham, SIAM Review“The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory.”~Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications “Succeeds dramatically ... a hell of a good book.” MAA Reviews“A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors.” Mathematika   “ ... like listening to someone explain mathematics.” Bulletin of the AMS},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new univariate forecasting method. The method is based on the concept of modifying the local curvature of the time-series through a coefficient 'Theta' (the Greek letter u), that is applied directly to the second differences of the data. The resulting series that are created maintain the mean and the slope of the original data but not their curvatures. These new time series are named Theta-lines. Their primary qualitative characteristic is the improvement of the approximation of the long-term behavior of the data or the augmentation of the short-term features, depending on the value of the Theta coefficient. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into two or more different Theta-lines. These are extrapolated separately and the subsequent forecasts are combined. The simple combination of two Theta-lines, the Theta 5 0 (straight line) and Theta 5 2 (double local curves) was adopted in order to produce forecasts for the 3003 series of the M3 competition. The method performed well, particularly for monthly series and for microeconomic data.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in allowing for asymmetry in the density forecasts of macroeconomic variables. In multivariate time series, this can be achieved with a copula model, where both serial and crosssectional dependence is captured by a copula function, and the margins are nonparametric. Yet most existing copulas cannot capture heteroscedasticity well, which is a feature of many economic and financial time series. To do so, we propose a new copula created by the inversion of a multivariate unobserved component stochastic volatility model, and show how to estimate it using Bayesian methods. We fit the copula model to real-time data on five quarterly U.S. economic and financial variables. The copula model captures heteroscedasticity, dependence in the level, time-variation in higher moments, bounds on variables and other features. Over the window 1975Q1-2016Q2, the real-time density forecasts of all the macroeconomic variables exhibit time-varying asymmetry. In particular, forecasts of GDP growth have increased negative skew during recessions. The point and density forecasts from the copula model are competitive with those from benchmark models-particularly for inflation, a short-term interest rate and current quarter GDP growth. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the M5 competition, which focused on forecasting the hierarchical unit sales of Walmart, was to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of forecasting methods in the field to identify best practices and highlight their practical implications. However, can the findings of the M5 competition be generalized and exploited by retail firms to better support their decisions and operation? This depends on the extent to which M5 data is sufficiently similar to unit sales data of retailers operating in different regions selling different product types and considering different marketing strategies. To answer this question, we analyze the characteristics of the M5 time series and compare them with those of two grocery retailers, namely Corporación Favorita and a major Greek supermarket chain, using feature spaces. Our results suggest only minor discrepancies between the examined data sets, supporting the representativeness of the M5 data.},

The present book not only combines the two approaches but it also has been guided by the need to give suitable matter for the beginner as well as illustrating some deeper aspects of the subject for the research worker. Practical examples are kept to the forefront and, wherever feasible, each technique is motivated by such an example.},

  abstract = {KMV Corporation has created the computer software KMV Credit Monitor, which is supposed to be a predictor for the credit rating migration ¿matrices. Apart from J.P. Morgan's CreditMetrics™ KMV Credit Monitor is the second financial sector-wide standard software. Due to this wide spread of KMV's software products in financial companies and because of its high ¿internal and external influence on the pricing of credit risk it is essential to explain the theoretic framework behind the KMV software. This paper deepens the understanding of this approach when used as credit rating predictor for companies. Unlike CreditMetrics™ that calculates a "Value at Risk due to Credit" KMV uses an equity value based approach to estimate a firm's credit risk. KMV provides a "rating" model rather than a "Value at Risk due to credit" model. The software is based on Merton's (197 4) option pricing approach. This approach is also known as the structural approach of pricing credit risk as it includes the asset-liability structure of a company. The motivation of this paper is to focus on the underlying assumptions of the models and to explain the resulting restrictions. This paper shows advantages and disadvantages of this credit risk measurement method.},

  abstract = {Hayashi’s Econometrics promises to be the next great synthesis of modern econometrics. It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.},

A survey could consist of data collected from a questionnaire or from measurements, such as those taken as part of a quality control process. Concerned with the statistical methods for the analysis of sample survey data, this book will update and extend the successful book edited by Skinner, Holt and Smith on 'Analysis of Complex Surveys'. The focus will be on methodological issues, which arise when applying statistical methods to sample survey data and will discuss in detail the impact of complex sampling schemes. Further issues, such as how to deal with missing data and measurement of error will also be critically discussed. There have significant improvements in statistical software which implement complex sampling schemes (eg SUDAAN, STATA, WESVAR, PC CARP ) in the last decade and there is greater need for practical advice for those analysing survey data. To ensure a broad audience, the statistical theory will be made accessible through the use of practical examples. This book will be accessible to a broad audience of statisticians but will primarily be of interest to practitioners analysing survey data. Increased awareness by social scientists of the variety of powerful statistical methods will make this book a useful reference.},

  abstract = {We propose a thin-plate spline based dynamic MR breast image registration approach under the assumption that only small alignment differences exist after global registration. Control point pairs between reference and sensed images are automatically and adaptively selected according to image gradient and local correlation of the image under translation and rotation. These landmarks are not homogeneously distributed, but are only located on skin lines, at edge corners and on contour ridges which visually demonstrate the structural deformation due to patient motion, normal breathing and cardiac motion. For MR breast sequences which have intensity changes after contrast injection, this method shows robust results and has less computational cost because of its dependence on fewer, but more effective, control points as compared to traditional iterative registration algorithms.},

  abstract = {We investigate the performance and sampling variability of estimated forecast combinations, with particular attention given to the combination of forecast distributions. Unknown parameters in the forecast combination are optimized according to criterion functions based on proper scoring rules, which are chosen to reward the form of forecast accuracy that matters for the problem at hand, and forecast performance is measured using the out-of-sample expectation of said scoring rule. Our results provide novel insights into the behavior of estimated forecast combinations. Firstly, we show that, asymptotically, the sampling variability in the performance of standard forecast combinations is determined solely by estimation of the constituent models, with estimation of the combination weights contributing no sampling variability whatsoever, at first order. Secondly, we show that, if computationally feasible, forecast combinations produced in a single step – in which the constituent model and combination function parameters are estimated jointly – have superior predictive accuracy and lower sampling variability than standard forecast combinations – where constituent model and combination function parameters are estimated in two steps. These theoretical insights are demonstrated numerically, both in simulation settings and in an extensive empirical illustration using a time series of S\&P500 returns.},

Deep forecasting models, however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the notion of such perturbations, together with that of robustness, has not even been completely established in the regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for robust probabilistic time series forecasting. First, we generalize the concept of adversarial input perturbations, based on which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms of bounded Wasserstein deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique to attain robust probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates against certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the forecast quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency under supplement of noisy observations.},

  abstract = {Dynamic transportation networks have been analyzed for years by means of static graphbased indicators in order to study the temporal evolution of relevant network components, and to reveal complex dependencies that would not be easily detected by a direct inspection of the data. This paper presents a state-of-the-art probabilistic latent network model to forecast multilayer dynamic graphs that are increasingly common in transportation and proposes a community-based extension to reduce the computational burden. Flexible time series analysis is obtained by modeling the probability of edges between vertices through latent Gaussian processes. The models and Bayesian inference are illustrated on a sample of 10-year data from four major airlines within the US air transportation system. Results show how the estimated latent parameters from the models are related to the airlines’ connectivity dynamics, and their ability to project the multilayer graph into the future for out-of-sample full network forecasts, while stochastic blockmodeling allows for the identification of relevant communities. Reliable network predictions would allow policy-makers to better understand the dynamics of the transport system, and help in their planning on e.g. route development, or the deployment of new regulations.},

In contrast with most of the existing approaches, our framework performs forecast selection and combination in one step, allowing for potentially sparse combining schemes. Moreover, by exploiting the analogy between forecasts combination and portfolio optimization, we provide the analytical expression of the optimal penalty strength when penalizing with the L2-divergence from the equally-weighted scheme. An extensive simulation study and two empirical applications allow us to investigate the impact of the divergence function, the reference scheme, and the non-negativity constraint on the predictive performance. Our results suggest that the proposed models outperform those considered in previous studies.},

Parsimony in such models is highly valued for their interpretability and generalisation, and as such the identification of model orders remains a fundamental task. We propose a novel method of ARMA order identification through projection predictive inference. Our procedure provides a fully Bayesian, information-theoretic analogue to frequentist order identification procedures, naturally allowing uncertainty quantification in order identification and the ability to encode prior beliefs. It benefits from improved stability through the use of a reference model, and a lower algorithmic complexity than alternatives through our proposed search heuristic. The submodels selected by our procedure are shown to have predictive performance at least as good as those produced by prevalent frequentist methods over simulated and real-data experiments, and in some cases outperform the latter. Finally we show that our procedure is demonstrably robust to noisy data, and scales well to larger data.},

We introduce a communication-efficient distributed algorithm to estimate the rank-deficient loading matrix in reduced rank regressions. The distributed algorithm, which proceeds iteratively, reduces the computational complexity substantially. During each iteration, it yields a closed-form solution and refines the previous estimators gradually. After a finite number of iterations, the final solution estimates the rank consistently, and more importantly, achieves the oracle rate. We recast sufficient dimension reduction methods under the framework of reduced rank regressions, which enables us to recover the central subspace and simultaneously estimate its structural dimension. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed distributed algorithm through simulations and an application to the airline on-line performance dataset consisting of 118,914,458 observations.},

First, it is more general than combining a set of single point forecasts. Second, the asymptotic optimality is generally dependent on the estimation scheme and the asymptotic ratio of the length of forecast sequence relative to the in-sample size. Third, the asymptotically optimal weights may be consistently estimated under suitable conditions, while it needs the time series to be sufficiently long. We also assess the forecasting performance of our method using simulation data and real data.},

Variables are absent during inference because of longterm data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high→low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been studied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the performance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF setting. We propose a non-parametric, wrapper technique that can be applied on top any existing forecast models. Through systematic experiments across 4 datasets and 5 forecast models, we show that our technique is able to recover close to 95\% performance of the models even when only 15\% of the original variables are present.},

  abstract = {As a prevalent distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) trains a global model on a massive amount of devices with infrequent communication. This paper investigates a class of composite optimization and statistical recovery problems in the FL setting, whose loss function consists of a data-dependent smooth loss and a non-smooth regularizer. Examples include sparse linear regression using Lasso, low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization, etc. In the existing literature, federated composite optimization algorithms are designed only from an optimization perspective without any statistical guarantees. In addition, they do not consider commonly used (restricted) strong convexity in statistical recovery problems. We advance the frontiers of this problem from both optimization and statistical perspectives. From optimization upfront, we propose a new algorithm named Fast Federated Dual Averaging for strongly convex and smooth loss and establish state-of-the-art iteration and communication complexity in the composite setting. In particular, we prove that it enjoys a fast rate, linear speedup, and reduced communication rounds. From statistical upfront, for restricted strongly convex and smooth loss, we design another algorithm, namely Multi-stage Federated Dual Averaging, and prove a high probability complexity bound with linear speedup up to optimal statistical precision. Numerical experiments in both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our methods perform better than other baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing fast optimization algorithms and statistical recovery guarantees for composite problems in FL.},

  title = {Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer},
  author = {Pearl, Judea},
  abstract = {Causality is central to the understanding and use of data. Without an understanding of causeeffect relationships, we cannot use data to answer questions as basic as Does this treatment harm or help patients? But though hundreds of introductory texts are available on statistical methods of data analysis, until now, no beginner-level book has been written about the exploding arsenal of methods that can tease causal information from data. Causal Inference in Statistics fills that gap. Using simple examples and plain language, the book lays out how to define causal parameters; the assumptions necessary to estimate causal parameters in a variety of situations; how to express those assumptions mathematically; whether those assumptions have testable implications; how to predict the effects of interventions; and how to reason counterfactually. These are the foundational tools that any student of statistics needs to acquire in order to use statistical methods to answer causal questions of interest. This book is accessible to anyone with an interest in interpreting data, from undergraduates, professors, researchers, or to the interested layperson. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of fields, including medicine, public policy, and law; a brief introduction to probability and statistics is provided for the uninitiated; and each chapter comes with study questions to reinforce the readers understanding.

  abstract = {We propose Bayesian inference for the factor copula model proposed by Krupskii \& Joe (2013). There are two significant advantages that Bayesian inference has over classical inference for this model. The first is that it is straightforward to conduct inference on the latent factor since iterates of the latent factor are generated in our Markov chain Monte Carlo, whereas in classical inference the latent factor is integrated out of the likelihood using quadrature methods. Second, by developing a Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme we are able to select a factor copula model or average over different models by selecting bivariate copula building blocks from a large set of candidate parametric families. Through extensive simulation studies where we consider multiple schemes, we develop an algorithm that balances computational and Monte Carlo efficiency, provides reliable inference on all parameters including the latent factor and successfully explores a large model space. The potential of the approach is demonstrated using financial returns data on up to 26 different economies. The estimated factor correlates with known global economic shocks and asymmetric tail dependence in uncovered for some markets.},

We do linear regression on each machine, send the results to a central server, and take a weighted average of the parameters. Optionally, we iterate, sending back the weighted average and doing local ridge regressions centered at it. How does this work compared to doing linear regression on the full data? Here we study the performance loss in estimation, test error, and confidence interval length in high dimensions, where the number of parameters is comparable to the training data size.},

These series are linked by hierarchical constraints—global consumption is the sum of regional consumption, for example. First, benchmark forecasts are generated for all series using generalized additive models. Second, for each series, the aggregation algorithm ML-Poly, introduced by Gaillard, Stoltz, and van Erven in 2014, finds an optimal linear combination of the benchmarks. Finally, the forecasts are projected onto a coherent subspace to ensure that the final forecasts satisfy the hierarchical constraints. By minimizing a regret criterion, we show that the aggregation and projection steps improve the root mean square error of the forecasts. Our approach is tested on household electricity consumption data; experimental results suggest that successive aggregation and projection steps improve the benchmark forecasts at different levels of household aggregation.},

Our experiments show that our forecasting tool is effective for cyclic data but somewhat less for irregular data such as stock prices.

  abstract = {Class imbalance is a common problem in supervised learning and impedes the predictive performance of classification models. Popular countermeasures include oversampling the minority class. Standard methods like SMOTE rely on finding nearest neighbours and linear interpolations which are problematic in case of high-dimensional, complex data distributions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed as an alternative method for generating artificial minority examples as they can model complex distributions. However, prior research on GAN-based oversampling does not incorporate recent advancements from the literature on generating realistic tabular data with GANs. Previous studies also focus on numerical variables whereas categorical features are common in many business applications of classification methods such as credit scoring. The paper propoes an oversampling method based on a conditional Wasserstein GAN that can effectively model tabular datasets with numerical and categorical variables and pays special attention to the down-stream classification task through an auxiliary classifier loss. We benchmark our method against standard oversampling methods and the imbalanced baseline on seven real-world datasets. Empirical results evidence the competitiveness of GAN-based oversampling.},

Models are fitted using bias-corrected least squares in order to attenuate the effects of small sample bias of forecast loss. We begin by constructing a general estimator of the quadratic forecast risk of the averaged model that is asymptotically unbiased as both n (cross sections) and T (time series) grow large. Armed with this result, we propose a specific weighting mechanism, in which weights are chosen to minimize the estimated quadratic risk of the averaged forecast error. The objective function in this minimization problem is a version of the Mallows Cp criterion modified for application to the panel data setting. The forecast combination method performs well in Monte Carlo simulations and pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting applications.},

However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a prevailing distributed learning paradigm, where a large number of workers jointly learn a model without sharing their training data. However, high communication costs could arise in FL due to large-scale (deep) learning models and bandwidth-constrained connections. In this paper, we introduce a communication-efficient algorithmic framework called CFedAvg for FL with non-i.i.d. datasets, which works with general (biased or unbiased) SNR-constrained compressors. We analyze the convergence rate of CFedAvg for non-convex functions with constant and decaying learning rates. The CFedAvg algorithm can achieve an \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(1 / \textbackslash sqrt\{mKT\} + 1 / T)\$ convergence rate with a constant learning rate, implying a linear speedup for convergence as the number of workers increases, where \$K\$ is the number of local steps, \$T\$ is the number of total communication rounds, and \$m\$ is the total worker number. This matches the convergence rate of distributed/federated learning without compression, thus achieving high communication efficiency while not sacrificing learning accuracy in FL. Furthermore, we extend CFedAvg to cases with heterogeneous local steps, which allows different workers to perform a different number of local steps to better adapt to their own circumstances. The interesting observation in general is that the noise/variance introduced by compressors does not affect the overall convergence rate order for non-i.i.d. FL. We verify the effectiveness of our CFedAvg algorithm on three datasets with two gradient compression schemes of different compression ratios.},

Understanding the heterogeneity in state-level mortality experience is of fundamental importance, as it can assist decision making for policymakers, health authorities, as well as local communities who are seeking to reduce inequalities and disparities in life expectancy. A key challenge of multi-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures across sub-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the state-level forecasts are coherent with the nationallevel forecasts. We address these issues by first obtaining independent state-level forecasts based on classical stochastic mortality models, and then incorporating the dependence structure in the forecast reconciliation process. Both traditional bottom-up reconciliation and the cutting-edge trace minimization reconciliation methods are considered. Based on the U.S. total mortality data for the period 1969–2017, we project the 10-year-ahead mortality rates at both national-level and state-level up to 2027. We find that the geographical inequality in the longevity levels is likely to continue in the future, and the mortality improvement rates will tend to slow down in the coming decades.},

Consequently, we map all major past competitions in respect to their design attributes, identifying similarities and differences between them, as well as design gaps, and making suggestions about the principles to be included in future competitions, putting a particular emphasis on learning as much as possible from their implementation in order to help improve forecasting accuracy and uncertainty. We discuss that the task of forecasting often presents a multitude of challenges that can be difficult to be captured in a single forecasting contest. To assess the quality of a forecaster, we, therefore, propose that organizers of future competitions consider a multi-contest approach.

  abstract = {Global Forecasting Models (GFM) that are trained across a set of multiple time series have shown superior results in many forecasting competitions and real-world applications compared with univariate forecasting approaches. One aspect of the popularity of statistical forecasting models such as ETS and ARIMA is their relative simplicity and interpretability (in terms of relevant lags, trend, seasonality, and others), while GFMs typically lack interpretability, especially towards particular time series. This reduces the trust and confidence of the stakeholders when making decisions based on the forecasts without being able to understand the predictions. To mitigate this problem, in this work, we propose a novel local model-agnostic interpretability approach to explain the forecasts from GFMs. We train simpler univariate surrogate models that are considered interpretable (e.g., ETS) on the predictions of the GFM on samples within a neighbourhood that we obtain through bootstrapping or straightforwardly as the one-step-ahead global black-box model forecasts of the time series which needs to be explained. After, we evaluate the explanations for the forecasts of the global models in both qualitative and quantitative aspects such as accuracy, fidelity, stability and comprehensibility, and are able to show the benefits of our approach.},

Public transport users are particularly sensitive to unexpected waiting times, which negatively affect their perception on the system’s reliability. In this paper we develop a robust model for real-time bus travel time prediction that depart from Gaussian assumptions by using Student-t errors. The proposed approach uses spatiotemporal characteristics from the route and previous bus trips to model short-term effects, and date/time variables and Gaussian processes for long-run forecasts. The model allows for flexible modeling of mean, variance and kurtosis spaces. We propose algorithms for Bayesian inference and for computing probabilistic forecast distributions. Experiments are performed using data from high-frequency buses in Stockholm, Sweden. Results show that Student-t models outperform Gaussian ones in terms of log-posterior predictive power to forecast bus delays at specific stops, which reveals the importance of accounting for predictive uncertainty in model selection. Estimated Student-t regressions capture typical temporal variability between within-day hours and different weekdays. Strong spatiotemporal effects are detected for incoming buses from immediately previous stops, which is in line with many recently developed models. We finally show how Bayesian inference naturally allows for predictive uncertainty quantification, e.g. by returning the predictive probability that the delay of an incoming bus exceeds a given threshold.},

  abstract = {The automated detection of sequential anomalies in time series is an essential task for many applications, such as the monitoring of technical systems, fraud detection in high-frequency trading, or the early detection of disease symptoms. All these applications require the detection to find all sequential anomalies possibly fast on potentially very large time series. In other words, the detection needs to be effective, efficient and scalable w.r.t. the input size. Series2Graph is an effective solution based on graph embeddings that are robust against re-occurring anomalies and can discover sequential anomalies of arbitrary length and works without training data. Yet, Series2Graph is no t scalable due to its single-threaded approach; it cannot, in particular, process arbitrarily large sequences due to the memory constraints of a single machine. In this paper, we propose our distributed anomaly detection system, short DADS, which is an efficient and scalable adaptation of Series2Graph. Based on the actor programming model, DADS distributes the input time sequence, intermediate state and the computation to all processors of a cluster in a way that minimizes communication costs and synchronization barriers. Our evaluation shows that DADS is orders of magnitude faster than S2G, scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the cluster and can process much larger input sequences due to its scale-out property.},

The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved postsample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

This may lead to erroneous conclusions on the similarities of the curves. In this case, most functional clustering measures underperform in (for example) the analysis of stock market data. To address this methodological limitation, a new similarity measure that is based on extreme point bias compensation is proposed in this paper. By penalizing the curves with the temporal deviation of extreme points and rewarding the curves that are close to each other, the new similarity measure better reflects the shape of the curve. In addition, the proposed method overcomes the difficulty of unifying the dimensions of the horizontal and vertical axes (i.e., time and function value) when calculating the distance between two adjacent extreme points. Finally, an empirical example of stock return analysis verifies the validity of this new measure.},

Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss and classification loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17\%.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the task of building efficient regression models for sparse multivariate analysis of high dimensional data sets, in particular it focuses on cases where the numbers q of responses Y = (yk, 1 ≤ k ≤ q) and p of predictors X = (xj , 1 ≤ j ≤ p) to analyse jointly are both large with respect to the sample size n, a challenging bi-directional situation of ‘large p, small n’ paradigm. The analysis of such data sets arise commonly in genetical genomics, with X linked to the DNA characteristics and Y corresponding to measurements of fundamental biological processes such as transcription, protein or metabolite production. Building on the Bayesian variable selection set-up for the linear model and associated efficient MCMC algorithms that deal with single responses, we discuss the generic framework of hierarchical related sparse regressions, where parallel regressions of y on the set of cok variates X are linked in a hierarchical fashion, in particular through the prior model of the variable selection indicators γkj , which indicate among the covariates xj those which are associated to the response yk in each multivariate regression. Structures for the joint model of the γkj , which correspond to different compromises between the aims of controlling sparsity and that of enhancing the detection of predictors that are associated with many responses (‘hot spots’), will be discussed and a new multiplicative model for the probability structure of the γkj will be presented. To perform inference for these models in high dimensional set-ups, novel adaptive MCMC algorithms are needed. As sparsity is paramount and most of the associations expected to be zero, new algorithms that progressively focus on part of the space where the most interesting associations occur are of great interest. We shall discuss their formulation and theoretical properties, and demonstrate their use on simulated and real data from genomics.},

Unlike traditional texts, this book's practical, yet professional, approach demonstrates how econometrics has moved beyond a set of abstract tools to become genuinely useful for answering questions across a variety of disciplines. The author has organized the book's presentation around the type of data being analyzed with a systematic approach that only introduces assumptions as they are needed. This makes the material easier to understand and, ultimately, leads to better econometric practices. Packed with relevant applications, the text incorporates more than 100 data sets in different formats. Updates introduce the latest developments in the field, including the recent advances in the so-called �causal effects� or �treatment effects," to provide a complete understanding of the impact and importance of econometrics today.},

Parsimony in such models is highly valued for their interpretability and generalisation, and as such the identification of model orders remains a fundamental task. We propose a novel method of ARMA order identification through projection predictive inference. Our procedure provides a fully Bayesian, information-theoretic analogue to frequentist order identification procedures, naturally allowing uncertainty quantification in order identification and the ability to encode prior beliefs. It benefits from improved stability through the use of a reference model, and a lower algorithmic complexity than alternatives through our proposed search heuristic. The submodels selected by our procedure are shown to have predictive performance at least as good as those produced by prevalent frequentist methods over simulated and real-data experiments, and in some cases outperform the latter. Finally we show that our procedure is demonstrably robust to noisy data, and scales well to larger data.},

  abstract = {Sequential auction models of labor market competition predict that the wages required to successfully poach a worker from a rival employer will depend on the productivities of both the poached and poaching firms. We develop a theoretically grounded extension of the two-way fixed effects model of Abowd et al. (1999) in which log hiring wages are comprised of a worker fixed effect, a fixed effect for the ‘‘destination’’ firm hiring the worker, and a fixed effect for the ‘‘origin’’ firm, or labor market state, from which the worker was hired. This specification is shown to nest the reduced form for hiring wages delivered by semi-parametric formulations of the canonical sequential auction model of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b) and its generalization in Bagger et al. (2014). Fitting the model to Italian social security records, origin effects are found to explain only 0.7\% of the variance of hiring wages among job movers, while destination effects explain more than 23\% of the variance. Across firms, destination effects are more than 13 times as variable as origin effects. Interpreted through the lens of Bagger et al. (2014)’s model, this finding requires that workers possess implausibly strong bargaining strength. Studying a cohort of workers entering the Italian labor market in 2005, we find that differences in origin effects yield essentially no contribution to the evolution of the gender gap in hiring wages, while differences in destination effects explain the majority of the gap at the time of labor market entry. These results suggest that where a worker is hired from tends to be relatively inconsequential for their wages in comparison to where they are currently employed.},

Currently, the state of the art in time series classification is dominated by Collective of Transformation-Based Ensembles. This algorithm is composed of several classifiers of diverse nature that are combined according to their results in an internal cross validation procedure. Its high complexity prevents it from being applied to large datasets. One Nearest Neighbours with Dynamic Time Warping remains the base classifier in any time series classification problem, for its simplicity and good results. Despite their good performance, they share a weakness, which is that they are not interpretable. In the field of time series classification, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a set of characteristics capable of extracting information of the structure of the time series in order to face time series classification problems. The use of these characteristics allows the use of traditional classification algorithms in time series problems. The experimental results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of the results obtained by our proposal with respect to the original time series. Apart from the improvement in accuracy, our proposal is able to offer interpretable results based on the set of characteristics proposed.},

The M4 competition was the first in which a model of the type commonly described as ‘‘machine learning’’ has outperformed the more traditional statistical approaches, winning the competition. However, many approaches that were self-labeled as ‘‘machine learning’’ failed to produce accurate results, which generated discussion about the respective benefits and drawbacks of ‘‘statistical’’ and ‘‘machine learning’’ approaches. Both terms have remained ill-defined in the context of forecasting. This paper introduces the terms ‘‘structured’’ and ‘‘unstructured’’ models to better define what is intended by the use of the terms ‘‘statistical’’ and ‘‘machine learning’’ in the context of forecasting based on the model’s data generating process. The mechanisms that underlie specific challenges to unstructured modeling are examined in the context of forecasting, along with common solutions. Finally, the innovations in the winning model that allowed it to overcome these challenges and produce highly accurate results are highlighted.},

The proposed framework provides a probabilistic foundation for hierarchical random measures, and allows for studying their properties under the alternative assumptions of diffuse, atomic and mixed base measure. We show that hierarchical species sampling models have a Chinese Restaurants Franchise representation and can be used as prior distributions to undertake Bayesian nonparametric inference. We provide a general sampling method for posterior approximation which easily accounts for non-diffuse base measures such as spike-and-slab.},

Using microdata from the three major surveys of professional forecasters (Euro Area, US and UK), we examine real GDP growth forecasts over the period 1999–2015. Our findings show that overconfidence dominates among individual forecasters, particularly for longer forecast horizons, and that individual forecasters appear to have little understanding of their own uncertainty.},

This paper studies distributed estimation for a fundamental statistical machine learning problem, principal component analysis (PCA). Despite the massive literature on top eigenvector estimation, much less is presented for the top-L-dim (L {$>$} 1) eigenspace estimation, especially in a distributed manner. We propose a novel multi-round algorithm for constructing top-L-dim eigenspace for distributed data. Our algorithm takes advantage of shift-and-invert preconditioning and convex optimization. Our estimator is communication-efficient and achieves a fast convergence rate. In contrast to the existing divide-and-conquer algorithm, our approach has no restriction on the number of machines. Theoretically, we establish a gap-free error bound and abandon the assumption on the sharp eigengap between the L-th and the (L + 1)-th eigenvalues. Our distributed algorithm can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems ∗e-mail: xchen3@stern.nyu.edu.

  abstract = {This paper studies distributed estimation and support recovery for high-dimensional linear regression model with heavy-tailed noise. To deal with heavy-tailed noise whose variance can be infinite, we adopt the quantile regression loss function instead of the commonly used squared loss. However, the non-smooth quantile loss poses new challenges to high-dimensional distributed estimation in both computation and theoretical development. To address the challenge, we transform the response variable and establish a new connection between quantile regression and ordinary linear regression. Then, we provide a distributed estimator that is both computationally and communicationally efficient, where only the gradient information is communicated at each iteration. Theoretically, we show that, after a constant number of iterations, the proposed estimator achieves a near-oracle convergence rate without any restriction on the number of machines. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee for the support recovery. The simulation analysis is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Cross-sectional and temporal hierarchies have been considered in the literature, but generally, these two features have not been fully considered together. The paper presents two new results by adopting a notation that simultaneously deals with both forecast reconciliation dimensions. (i) The closed-form expression of the optimal (in the least squares sense) point forecasts fulfilling both contemporaneous and temporal constraints. (ii) An iterative procedure that produces cross-temporally reconciled forecasts by alternating forecast reconciliation along one single dimension (either cross-sectional or temporal) at each iteration step. The feasibility of the proposed procedures, along with first evaluations of their performance as compared to the most performing ‘single dimension’ (either crosssectional or temporal) forecast reconciliation procedures, is studied through a forecasting experiment on the 95 quarterly time series of the Australian Gross Domestic Product from Income and Expenditure sides. For this dataset, the new procedures, in addition to providing fully coherent forecasts in both cross-sectional and temporal dimensions, improve the forecast accuracy of the state-of-the-art point forecast reconciliation techniques.},

We address this core problem of performance prediction uncertainty with a method to compute prediction intervals for model performance. Our methodology uses transfer learning to train an uncertainty model to estimate the uncertainty of model performance predictions. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of drift conditions and show substantial improvement over competitive baselines.

  abstract = {In suitably initialized wide networks, small learning rates transform deep neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training. During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance matches that of full network training in 15\% to 45\% of training time. Overall, our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the development of more accurate theories of deep learning.},

  abstract = {Bayesian models often involve a small set of hyperparameters determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood. Bayesian optimization is a popular iterative method where a Gaussian process posterior of the underlying function is sequentially updated by new function evaluations. An acquisition strategy uses this posterior distribution to decide where to place the next function evaluation. We propose a novel Bayesian optimization framework for situations where the user controls the computational effort, and therefore the precision of the function evaluations. This is a common situation in econometrics where the marginal likelihood is often computed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, with the precision of the marginal likelihood estimate determined by the number of MCMC draws. The proposed acquisition strategy gives the optimizer the option to explore the function with cheap noisy evaluations and therefore finds the optimum faster. Prior hyperparameter estimation in the steady-state Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model on US macroeconomic time series data is used for illustration. The proposed method is shown to find the optimum much quicker than traditional Bayesian optimization or grid search.},

In the case where some covariates are unknowingly measured with error at the beginning of the stream, but then are measured without error after a particular point along the data stream, the updated estimators ignoring the measurement error are biased for the true parameters. Once the covariates measured without error are first observed, a method to correct the bias of the estimators, as well as to correct the biases in their variance estimator, is proposed; after correction, the traditional online updating method can then proceed as usual. Further, asymptotic distributions for the corrected and updated estimators are established.

This paper takes the reader on a chronological tour of Bayesian computation over the past two and a half centuries. Beginning with the one-dimensional integral first confronted by Bayes in 1763, through to recent problems in which the unknowns number in the millions, we place all computational problems into a common framework, and describe all computational methods using a common notation.

However, equivariant models are commonly implemented using large and computationally expensive architectures, not suitable to run on mobile devices. In this work, we design and test an equivariant version of MobileNetV2 and further optimize it with model quantization to enable more efficient inference. We achieve close-to state of the art performance on the Patch Camelyon (PCam) medical dataset while being more computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {I show how it can be beneficial to express Metropolis accept/reject decisions in terms of comparison with a uniform [0, 1] value, and to then update this uniform value non-reversibly, as part of the Markov chain state, rather than sampling it independently each iteration. This provides a small improvement for random walk Metropolis and Langevin updates in high dimensions. It produces a larger improvement when using Langevin updates with persistent momentum, giving performance comparable to that of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with long trajectories. This is of significance when some variables are updated by other methods, since if HMC is used, these updates can be done only between trajectories, whereas they can be done more often with Langevin updates. This is seen for a Bayesian neural network model, in which connection weights are updated by persistent Langevin or HMC, while hyperparameters are updated by Gibbs sampling.},

In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US.

  abstract = {Testing automotive mechatronic systems partly uses the software-in-the-loop approach, where systematically covering inputs of the system-under-test remains a major challenge. In current practice, there are two major techniques of input stimulation. One approach is to craft input sequences which eases control and feedback of the test process but falls short of exposing the system to realistic scenarios. The other is to replay sequences recorded from field operations which accounts for reality but requires collecting a well-labeled dataset of sufficient capacity for widespread use, which is expensive. This work applies the well-known unsupervised learning framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn an unlabeled dataset of recorded in-vehicle signals and uses it for generation of synthetic input stimuli. Additionally, a metric-based linear interpolation algorithm is demonstrated, which guarantees that generated stimuli follow a customizable similarity relationship with specified references. This combination of techniques enables controlled generation of a rich range of meaningful and realistic input patterns, improving virtual test coverage and reducing the need for expensive field tests.},

There are, however, numerous contexts of considerable scientific interest in which the natural supports for the data under consideration are Riemannian manifolds like the unit circle, torus, sphere and their extensions. Typically, such data can be represented using one or more directions, and directional statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with their analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the many recent developments in the field since the publication of Mardia and Jupp (1999), still the most comprehensive text on directional statistics. Many of those developments have been stimulated by interesting applications in fields as diverse as astronomy, medicine, genetics, neurology, aeronautics, acoustics, image analysis, text mining, environmetrics, and machine learning. We begin by considering developments for the exploratory analysis of directional data before progressing to distributional models, general approaches to inference, hypothesis testing, regression, nonparametric curve estimation, methods for dimension reduction, classification and clustering, and the modelling of time series, spatial, and spatio-temporal data. We end with an overview of presently available software for analyzing directional data.},

At first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for multiple short time series. Experiments conducted on three public datasets and two industrial datasets verify that the proposed BHT-ARIMA effectively improves forecasting accuracy and reduces computational cost compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Representation learning—a key tool for performing meta-learning—learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression—in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features, showing that our algorithms are optimal up to logarithmic factors.},

Then conduct one-step updating based on the computed derivatives of log-likelihood functions in each Worker at the pilot estimator. The final one-step estimator is proved to be statistically efficient as the global estimator, even with nonrandomly distributed data. In addition, it is computationally efficient, in terms of both communication cost and storage usage. Based on the one-step estimator, we also develop a likelihood ratio test for hypothesis testing. The theoretical properties of the one-step estimator and the corresponding likelihood ratio test are investigated. The finite sample performances are assessed through simulations.

  abstract = {A Bayesian decision analysis perspective on problems of constrained forecasting is presented and developed, motivated by increasing interest in problems of aggregate and hierarchical forecasting coupled with short-comings of traditional, purely inferential approaches. Foundational and pedagogic developments underlie new methodological approaches to such problems, explored and exemplified in contexts of total-constrained forecasting linked to motivating applications in commercial forecasting. The new perspective is complementary and integrated with traditional Bayesian inference approaches, while offering new practical methodology when the traditional view is challenged. Examples explore ranges of practically relevant loss functions in simple, illustrative contexts that highlight the opportunities for methodology as well as practically important questions of how constrained forecasting is impacted by dependencies among outcomes being predicted. The paper couples this core development with arguments in support of a broader view of Bayesian decision analysis than is typically adopted, involving studies of predictive distributions of loss function values under putative optimal decisions. Additional examples highlight the practical importance of this broader view in the constrained forecasting context. Extensions to more general constrained forecasting problems, and connections with broader interests in forecast reconciliation and aggregation are noted along with other broader considerations.},

When the dimension diverges at the rate of o( n), the asymptotic efficiency of the global maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), the one-step MLE, and the aggregated estimating equation (AEE) estimator for GLMs are established. A novel distributed estimator is then proposed√with two rounds of communication. It has the same asymptotic efficiency as the global MLE under pn = o( n). The assumption on the number of clients is more relaxed than that of the AEE estimator and the proposed method is thus more practical for real-world applications. Simulations and a case study demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed estimator.},

  abstract = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to address the problem of single image de-raining. However, the inherent ill-posed nature of the problem presents several challenges. We attempt to leverage powerful generative modeling capabilities of the recently introduced Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) by enforcing an additional constraint that the de-rained image must be indistinguishable from its corresponding ground truth clean image. The adversarial loss from GAN provides additional regularization and helps to achieve superior results. In addition to presenting a new approach to de-rain images, we introduce a new refined loss function and architectural novelties in the generator-discriminator pair for achieving improved results. The loss function is aimed at reducing artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality. The generator sub-network is constructed using the recently introduced densely connected networks, whereas the discriminator is designed to leverage global and local information to decide if an image is real/fake. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance. Furthermore, experimental results evaluated on object detection datasets using FasterRCNN also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method in improving the detection performance on images degraded by rain.},

However, a fundamental limitation of HMC is that it can not be applied to distributions with mixed discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose mixed HMC (MHMC) as a general framework to address this limitation. M-HMC is a novel family of MCMC algorithms that evolves the discrete and continuous variables in tandem, allowing more frequent updates of discrete variables while maintaining HMC’s ability to suppress random-walk behavior. We establish M-HMC’s theoretical properties, and present an efficient implementation with Laplace momentum that introduces minimal overhead compared to existing HMC methods. The superior performances of M-HMC over existing methods are demonstrated with numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), variable selection in Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), and correlated topic models (CTMs).},

However, batch-based DRL algorithms cannot guarantee the non-decreasing property of learned quantile curves especially at the early training stage, leading to abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce a general DRL framework by using non-crossing quantile regression to ensure the monotonicity constraint within each sampled batch, which can be incorporated with some well-known DRL algorithm. We demonstrate the validity of our method from both the theory and model implementation perspectives. Experiments on Atari 2600 Games show that some state-of-art DRL algorithms with the non-crossing modification can significantly outperform their baselines in terms of faster convergence speeds and better testing performance. In particular, our method can effectively recover the distribution information and thus dramatically increase the exploration efficiency when the reward space is extremely sparse.},

  abstract = {Time series prediction has been a long-standing research topic and an essential application in many domains. Modern time series collected from sensor networks (e.g., energy consumption and traffic flow) are often large-scale and incomplete with considerable corruption and missing values, making it difficult to perform accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a low-rank autoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework to model multivariate time series data. The key of LATC is to transform the original multivariate time series matrix (e.g., sensor×time point) to a third-order tensor structure (e.g., sensor×time of day×day) by introducing an additional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms and seasonality of time series as global patterns. With the tensor structure, we can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation problems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides minimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the original matrix representation into the objective function. The two components serve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture the global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e., similarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s. the same time of historical days). The autoregressive norm can better model the local temporal trends. Our numerical experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the integration of global and local trends in LATC in both missing data imputation and rolling prediction tasks.},

Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1× fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.},

Stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) is a popular method for scalable Bayesian inference for large independent data. Unfortunately when applied to dependent data, such as in SSMs, SGMCMC’s stochastic gradient estimates are biased as they break crucial temporal dependencies. To alleviate this, we propose stochastic gradient estimators that control this bias by performing additional computation in a ‘buffer’ to reduce breaking dependencies. Furthermore, we derive error bounds for this bias and show a geometric decay under mild conditions. Using these estimators, we develop novel SGMCMC samplers for discrete, continuous and mixed-type SSMs with analytic message passing. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our SGMCMC algorithms compared to batch MCMC, allowing us to scale inference to long time series with millions of time points.},

  abstract = {It is well known that Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods scale poorly with dataset size. A popular class of methods for solving this issue is stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC). These methods use a noisy estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior, which reduces the per iteration computational cost of the algorithm. Despite this, there are a number of results suggesting that stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), probably the most popular of these methods, still has computational cost proportional to the dataset size. We suggest an alternative log-posterior gradient estimate for stochastic gradient MCMC which uses control variates to reduce the variance. We analyse SGLD using this gradient estimate, and show that, under log-concavity assumptions on the target distribution, the computational cost required for a given level of accuracy is independent of the dataset size. Next, we show that a different control-variate technique, known as zero variance control variates, can be applied to SGMCMC algorithms for free. This postprocessing step improves the inference of the algorithm by reducing the variance of the MCMC output. Zero variance control variates rely on the gradient of the log-posterior; we explore how the variance reduction is affected by replacing this with the noisy gradient estimate calculated by SGMCMC.},

Using a regional climate model and a cyclone-tracking algorithm, we study how idealized deforestation and afforestation of Europe affect long-term changes in the number and intensity of cyclones, and their effects on precipitation. The number of cyclones over Europe is smaller for afforestation compared to deforestation, with differences starting from 10\% in regions near the west European coast and increasing towards the east to reach 80\%. This decrease is caused by the larger surface roughness in afforestation. The winter precipitation extremes are considerably reduced with afforestation, without a large decrease in mean precipitation because of the balancing effect of increased weak and moderate precipitation. The mean precipitation increases over central and southern Europe as a result of the summer precipitation increase caused by larger evapotranspiration and access to deeper soil moisture in the presence of trees. These different region-specific effects of afforestation are generally positive and could provide an important mitigation tool in a changing climate.},

Although it can be transformed into an SVD problem, KoPA offers a greater flexibility over low rank approximation, since it allows the user to choose the configuration of the Kronecker product. On the other hand, the configuration (the dimensions of the two smaller matrices forming the Kronecker product) to be used is usually unknown, and has to be determined from the data in order to obtain optimal balance between accuracy and complexity. We propose to use an extended information criterion to select the configuration. Under the paradigm of high dimensionality, we show that the proposed procedure is able to select the true configuration with probability tending to one, under suitable conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio.

Some recent work proposed interesting algorithms that can deal with the scenario when up to half of the workers are compromised. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can deal with an arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers. The main idea is to ask the parameter server to randomly select a small clean dataset and compute noisy gradient using this small dataset. This noisy gradient will then be used as a ground truth to filter out information sent by compromised workers. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to the neighborhood of the population minimizer regardless the number of Byzantine attackers. We further provide numerical examples to show that the proposed algorithm can benefit from the presence of good workers and achieve better performance than existing algorithms.},

Yet, there are no papers that provide a general solution for combining these features, due to computational complexity. Moreover, homoskedastic Bayesian VARs for large data sets so far restrict substantially the allowed prior distributions on the parameters. In this paper we propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure for (possibly very large) VARs featuring time-varying volatilities and general priors. We show that indeed empirically the new estimation procedure performs well in applications to both structural analysis and out-of-sample forecasting.},

  abstract = {Forecasting is an important task across several domains. Its generalised interest is related to the uncertainty and complex evolving structure of time series. Forecasting methods are typically designed to cope with temporal dependencies among observations, but it is widely accepted that none is universally applicable. Therefore, a common solution to these tasks is to combine the opinion of a diverse set of forecasts. In this paper we present an approach based on arbitrating, in which several forecasting models are dynamically combined to obtain predictions. Arbitrating is a metalearning approach that combines the output of experts according to predictions of the loss that they will incur. We present an approach for retrieving out-of-bag predictions that significantly improves its data efficiency. Finally, since diversity is a fundamental component in ensemble methods, we propose a method for explicitly handling the inter-dependence between experts when aggregating their predictions. Results from extensive empirical experiments provide evidence of the method’s competitiveness relative to state of the art approaches. The proposed method is publicly available in a software package.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a largescale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 5001000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

To tackle this difficulty, we explore a Gibbs version of the Approximate Bayesian computation approach that runs component-wise approximate Bayesian computation steps aimed at the corresponding conditional posterior distributions, and based on summary statistics of reduced dimensions. While lacking the standard justifications for the Gibbs sampler, the resulting Markov chain is shown to converge in distribution under some partial independence conditions. The associated stationary distribution can further be shown to be close to the true posterior distribution and some hierarchical versions of the proposed mechanism enjoy a closed form limiting distribution. Experiments also demonstrate the gain in efficiency brought by the Gibbs version over the standard solution.},

The conjugate gradient method is an iterative method which offers rapid convergence to the solution, particularly when an effective preconditioner is employed. However, for more challenging systems a substantial error can be present even after many iterations have been performed. The estimates obtained in this case are of little value unless further information can be provided about, for example, the magnitude of the error. In this paper we propose a novel statistical model for this error, set in a Bayesian framework. Our approach is a strict generalisation of the conjugate gradient method, which is recovered as the posterior mean for a particular choice of prior. The estimates obtained are analysed with Krylov subspace methods and a contraction result for the posterior is presented. The method is then analysed in a simulation study as well as being applied to a challenging problem in medical imaging.},

For smooth convex and non-convex objective functions, we provide matching lower and upper complexity bounds and show that a naive pipeline parallelization of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent is optimal. For non-smooth convex functions, we provide a novel algorithm coined Pipeline Parallel Random Smoothing (PPRS) that is within a d1/4 multiplicative factor of the optimal convergence rate, where d is the underlying dimension. While the convergence rate still obeys a slow ε−2 convergence rate, the depth-dependent part is accelerated, resulting in a near-linear speed-up and convergence time that only slightly depends on the depth of the deep learning architecture. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of the non-smooth non-convex case and show that, for difficult and highly non-smooth problems, PPRS outperforms more traditional optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent for problems where the sample size is limited, such as few-shot or adversarial learning.},

The iterations make HMC computationally costly, especially in problems with large datasets, since it is necessary to compute posterior densities and their derivatives with respect to the parameters. Naively computing the Hamiltonian dynamics on a subset of the data causes HMC to lose its key ability to generate distant parameter proposals with high acceptance probability. The key insight in our article is that efficient subsampling HMC for the parameters is possible if both the dynamics and the acceptance probability are computed from the same data subsample in each complete HMC iteration. We show that this is possible to do in a principled way in a HMC-within-Gibbs framework where the subsample is updated using a pseudo marginal MH step and the parameters are then updated using an HMC step, based on the current subsample. We show that our subsampling methods are fast and compare favorably to two popular sampling algorithms that utilize gradient estimates from data subsampling. We also explore the current limitations of subsampling HMC algorithms by varying the quality of the variance reducing control variates used in the estimators of the posterior density and its gradients.},

  abstract = {In a 1970 Biometrika paper, W. K. Hastings developed a broad class of Markov chain algorithms for sampling from probability distributions that are difficult to sample from directly. The algorithm draws a candidate value from a proposal distribution and accepts the candidate with a probability that can be computed using only the unnormalized density of the target distribution, allowing one to sample from distributions known only up to a constant of proportionality. The stationary distribution of the corresponding Markov chain is the target distribution one is attempting to sample from. The Hastings algorithm generalizes the Metropolis algorithm to allow a much broader class of proposal distributions instead of just symmetric cases. An important class of applications for the Hastings algorithm corresponds to sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions, which have densities given by a prior density multiplied by a likelihood function and divided by a normalizing constant equal to the marginal likelihood. The marginal likelihood is typically intractable, presenting a fundamental barrier to implementation in Bayesian statistics. This barrier can be overcome by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. Amazingly, even after 50 years, the majority of algorithms used in practice today involve the Hastings algorithm. This article provides a brief celebration of the continuing impact of this ingenious algorithm on the 50th anniversary of its publication.},

Many existing work focuses on the averaging estimator, e.g., Zhang and Duchi (J Mach Learn Res 14:3321–3363, 2013) together with many others. We propose a one-step approach to enhance a simple-averaging based distributed estimator by utilizing a single Newton–Raphson updating. We derive the corresponding asymptotic properties of the newly proposed estimator. We find that the proposed one-step estimator enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the idealized centralized estimator. In particular, the asymptotic normality was established for the proposed estimator, while other competitors may not enjoy the same property. The proposed one-step approach merely requires one additional round of communication in relative to the averaging estimator; so the extra communication burden is insignificant. The proposed one-step approach leads to a lower upper bound of the mean squared error than other alternatives. In finite sample cases, numerical examples show that the proposed estimator outperforms the simple averaging estimator with a large margin in terms of the sample mean squared error. A potential application of the one-step approach is that one can use multiple machines to speed up large scale statistical inference with little compromise in the quality of estimators. The proposed method becomes more valuable when data can only be available at distributed machines with limited communication bandwidth.},

When considering all communication – both of gradients and of updated model weights – SKETCHEDSGD reduces the amount of communication required compared to other gradient compression methods from O(d) or O(W ) to O(log d), where d is the number of model parameters and W is the number of workers participating in training. We run experiments on a transformer model, an LSTM, and a residual network, demonstrating up to a 40x reduction in total communication cost with no loss in final model performance.

This is an extension of static vine copulas and a generalization of dynamic C-vine and D-vine copulas studied by Almeida et al (2016) and Goel and Mehra (2019). Within this class, we allow for time-varying dependence by driving the vine copula parameters with latent AR(1) processes. This modeling approach is very flexible but estimation is not straightforward due to the highdimensional parameter space. We propose a Bayesian estimation approach, which relies on a novel approximation of the posterior distribution. This approximation allows to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as elliptical slice sampling, in a sequential way. In contrast to other Bayesian sequential estimation procedures for vine copula models as proposed by Gruber and Czado (2015), there is no need to collapse copula parameters to point estimates before proceeding to the next tree. Thus more information and uncertainty is propagated from lower to higher trees. A simulation study shows satisfactory performance of the Bayesian procedure. This dynamic modeling and inference approach can be applied in various fields, where static vine copulas have already proven to be successful, including environmental sciences, medicine and finance. Here we study the dependence among 21 exchange rates. For comparison we also estimate a static vine copula model and dynamic C-vine and D-vine copula models. This comparison shows superior performance of the proposed dynamic vine copula model with respect to one day ahead forecasting accuracy.},

  abstract = {Stochastic-gradient-based optimization has been a core enabling methodology in applications to large-scale problems in machine learning and related areas. Despite the progress, the gap between theory and practice remains significant, with theoreticians pursuing mathematical optimality at a cost of obtaining specialized procedures in different regimes (e.g., modulus of strong convexity, magnitude of target accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio), and with practitioners not readily able to know which regime is appropriate to their problem, and seeking broadly applicable algorithms that are reasonably close to optimality. To bridge these perspectives it is necessary to study algorithms that are adaptive to different regimes. We present the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) method for composite convex finite-sum optimization problems and show that SCSG is adaptive to both strong convexity and target accuracy. The adaptivity is achieved by batch variance reduction with adaptive batch sizes and a novel technique, which we referred to as geometrization, which sets the length of each epoch as a geometric random variable. The algorithm achieves strictly better theoretical complexity than other existing adaptive algorithms, while the tuning parameters of the algorithm only depend on the smoothness parameter of the objective.},

  abstract = {We propose a new variational Bayes (VB) estimator for high-dimensional copulas with discrete, or a combination of discrete and continuous, margins. The method is based on a variational approximation to a tractable augmented posterior and is faster than previous likelihood-based approaches. We use it to estimate drawable vine copulas for univariate and multivariate Markov ordinal and mixed time series. These have dimension rT, where T is the number of observations and r is the number of series, and are difficult to estimate using previous methods. The vine pair-copulas are carefully selected to allow for heteroscedasticity, which is a feature of most ordinal time series data. When combined with flexible margins, the resulting time series models also allow for other common features of ordinal data, such as zero inflation, multiple modes, and under or overdispersion. Using six example series, we illustrate both the flexibility of the time series copula models and the efficacy of the VB estimator for copulas of up to 792 dimensions and 60 parameters. This far exceeds the size and complexity of copula models for discrete data that can be estimated using previous methods. An online appendix and MATLAB code implementing the method are available as supplementary materials.},

To avoid large matrix computations needed in a standard Gibbs sampler, we propose a novel Gibbs sampler called “Skinny Gibbs” which is much more scalable to high-dimensional problems, both in memory and in computational efficiency. In particular, its computational complexity grows only linearly in p, the number of predictors, while retaining the property of strong model selection consistency even when p is much greater than the sample size n. The present article focuses on logistic regression due to its broad applicability as a representative member of the generalized linear models. We compare our proposed method with several leading variable selection methods through a simulation study to show that Skinny Gibbs has a strong performance as indicated by our theoretical work.

They are theoretically well-understood and conceptually simple to apply in practice. The drawback of MCMC is that in general performing exact inference requires all of the data to be processed at each iteration of the algorithm. For large data sets, the computational cost of MCMC can be prohibitive, which has led to recent developments in scalable Monte Carlo algorithms that have a significantly lower computational cost than standard MCMC. In this paper, we focus on a particular class of scalable Monte Carlo algorithms, stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) which utilises data subsampling techniques to reduce the per-iteration cost of MCMC. We provide an introduction to some popular SGMCMC algorithms and review the supporting theoretical results, as well as comparing the efficiency of SGMCMC algorithms against MCMC on benchmark examples.

We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11\% over a statistical benchmark and by 3\% over last year’s winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.},

To assess whether similar results hold for economies with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on 151 aggregate and disaggregate economic series as well as 185 international variables, is introduced. An extensive empirical study is carried out investigating forecasts at different horizons, using a variety of methods and with information sets containing an increasing number of predictors. In contrast to other countries the results show that it is difficult to forecast Australian key macroeconomic variables more accurately than some simple benchmarks.

However, low rank approximations of the coefficient tensor can suffer if the true rank is not small. We propose a tensor regression framework which assumes a soft version of the parallel factors (PARAFAC) approximation. In contrast to classic PARAFAC, where each entry of the coefficient tensor is the sum of products of row-specific contributions across the tensor modes, the soft tensor regression (Softer) framework allows the row-specific contributions to vary around an overall mean. We follow a Bayesian approach to inference, and show that softening the PARAFAC increases model flexibility, leads to more precise predictions, improved estimation of coefficient tensors, and more accurate identification of important predictor entries, even for a low approximation rank. From a theoretical perspective, we show that the posterior distribution of the coefficient tensor based on Softer is weakly consistent irrespective of the true tensor or approximation rank. In the context of our motivating application, we adapt Softer to symmetric and semi-symmetric tensor predictors and analyze the relationship between brain network characteristics and human traits.},

We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series.

Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20\%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns. Last, we discuss broad implications of return forecast accuracy improvements in the areas such as inventory management, staffing level, reverse logistics, and return recovery decisions.},

We propose an algorithm called Multi-Resolution Estimator (MRE) whose expected error is no larger than O˜ m−1/max(d,2)n−1/2 , where d is the dimension of the parameter space. This error bound meets existing lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors, and is thereby order optimal. The expected error of MRE, unlike existing algorithms, tends to zero as the number of machines (m) goes to infinity, even when the number of samples per machine (n) remains upper bounded by a constant. This property of the MRE algorithm makes it applicable in new machine learning paradigms where m is much larger than n.},

Generally, such modelling is hampered by the non-stationary features of wind speed data that, to a large extent, reflect the turbulent dynamics in the atmosphere. We study how these features can be captured by nested ARIMA models. In this approach, wind speed fluctuations in given time windows are modelled by one stochastic process, and the parameter variation between successive windows by another one. For deriving the wind speed model, we use 20 months of data collected at the FINO1 platform at the North Sea and use a variable transformation that best maps the wind speed onto a Gaussian random variable. We find that wind speed increments can be well reproduced for up to four standard deviations. The distributions of extreme variations, however, strongly deviate from the model predictions.},

They approximate a target distribution—either the posterior or an augmented posterior—using a simpler distribution that is selected to balance accuracy with computational feasibility. Here we approximate an element-wise parametric transformation of the target distribution as multivariate Gaussian or skew-normal. Approximations of this kind are implicit copula models for the original parameters, with a Gaussian or skew-normal copula function and flexible parametric margins. A key observation is that their adoption can improve the accuracy of variational inference in high dimensions at limited or no additional computational cost. We consider the Yeo-Johnson and G\&H transformations, along with sparse factor structures for the scale matrix of the Gaussian or skew-normal. We also show how to implement efficient reparametrization gradient methods for these copula-based approximations. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated by computing posterior inference for three different models using six real datasets. In each case, we show that our proposed copula model distributions are more accurate variational approximations than Gaussian or skew-normal distributions, but at only a minor or no increase in computational cost.},

Our LAQ can provably attain the same linear convergence rate as the gradient descent in the strongly convex case, while effecting major savings in the communication overhead both in transmitted bits as well as in communication rounds.

  abstract = {We develop the setting of sequential prediction based on shifting experts and on a “smooth” version of the method of specialized experts. To aggregate expert predictions, we use the AdaHedge algorithm, which is a version of the Hedge algorithm with adaptive learning rate, and extend it by the meta-algorithm Fixed Share. Due to this, we combine the advantages of both algorithms: (1) we use the shifting regret which is a more optimal characteristic of the algorithm; (2) regret bounds are valid in the case of signed unbounded losses of the experts. Also, (3) we incorporate in this scheme a “smooth” version of the method of specialized experts which allows us to make more flexible and accurate predictions. All results are obtained in the adversarial setting—no assumptions are made about the nature of the data source. We present results of numerical experiments for short-term forecasting of electricity consumption based on real data.},

  abstract = {Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or dependent time series is a practically relevant and challenging task. Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data, and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes. Their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient, and allows them to provide uncertainty estimates. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efficiency, accuracy and computational complexity.},

  abstract = {The classical vector autoregressive model is a fundamental tool for multivariate time series analysis. However, it involves too many parameters when the number of time series and lag order are even moderately large. This paper proposes to rearrange the coefficient matrices of the model into a tensor form such that the parameter space can be restricted in three directions simultaneously via tensor decomposition. The proposed method substantially expands the capacity of vector autoregressive modeling for a large number of time series. In contrast, the widely used reduced-rank regression method can restrict the parameter space in only one direction. Moreover, to handle high-dimensional time series, this paper considers imposing sparsity on factor matrices to improve the interpretability and estimation efficiency, which leads to a sparsity-inducing estimator. For the low-dimensional case, we derive asymptotic properties of the proposed least squares estimator and introduce an alternating least squares algorithm. For the high-dimensional case, we establish non-asymptotic properties of the sparsity-inducing estimator and propose an ADMM-based algorithm for regularized estimation. Simulation experiments and a real data example demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over various existing methods.},

Most importantly, we propose a novel deep generative model, conditional Long Short-Term Memory - Generative Adversarial Network (LSTM-GAN) for melody generation from lyrics, which contains a deep LSTM generator and a deep LSTM discriminator both conditioned on lyrics. In particular, lyrics-conditioned melody and alignment relationship between syllables of given lyrics and notes of predicted melody are generated simultaneously.

We explicitly characterize the class of optimal proposal distributions under this framework, which we refer to as locallybalanced proposals, and prove their Peskun-optimality in high-dimensional regimes. The resulting algorithms are straightforward to implement in discrete spaces and provide orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency compared to alternative MCMC schemes, including discrete versions of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Simulations are performed with both simulated and real datasets, including a detailed application to Bayesian record linkage. A direct connection with gradient-based MCMC suggests that locally-balanced proposals may be seen as a natural way to extend the latter to discrete spaces.},

Samples generated by existing textto-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256×256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.},

As input time steps need not to be consecutive, the number of distinct samples increases from linearly to combinatorially many. By breaking the temporal order, this technique also helps transformers to capture dependencies among time steps in finer granularity.

  abstract = {With high-dimensional data emerging in various domains, sparse logistic regression models have gained much interest of researchers. Variable selection plays a key role in both improving the prediction accuracy and enhancing the interpretability of built models. Bayesian variable selection approaches enjoy many advantages such as high selection accuracy, easily incorporating many kinds of prior knowledge and so on. Because Bayesian methods generally make inference from the posterior distribution with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, however, they become intractable in high-dimensional situations due to the large searching space. To address this issue, a novel variational Bayesian method for variable selection in high-dimensional logistic regression models is presented. The proposed method is based on the indicator model in which each covariate is equipped with a binary latent variable indicating whether it is important. The Bernoullitype prior is adopted for the latent indicator variable. As for the specification of the hyperparameter in the Bernoulli prior, we provide two schemes to determine its optimal value so that the novel model can achieve sparsity adaptively. To identify important variables and make predictions, one efficient variational Bayesian approach is employed to make inference from the posterior distribution. The experiments conducted with both synthetic and some publicly available data show that the new method outperforms or is very competitive with some other popular counterparts.},

However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of substantially complicating the process of drawing inferences from the model. In particular, inference can become challenging when the support of the model varies between executions. Though general-purpose inference engines have been designed to operate in such settings, they are typically highly inefficient, often relying on proposing from the prior to make transitions. To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine (DCC). DCC divides the program into separate straight-line sub-programs, each of which has a fixed support allowing more powerful inference algorithms to be run locally, before recombining their outputs in a principled fashion. We show how DCC can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine, and empirically confirm that it can provide substantial performance improvements over previous approaches.},

In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook’s scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook’s user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

This method can efficiently compute the conditional distribution of the response variable given the explanatory variables. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic conditional cumulative distribution function and quantile functions arising from vine copulas. Assuming all variables have been transformed to standard normal, the conditional quantile function could be asymptotically linear, sublinear, or constant with respect to the explanatory variables in different extreme directions, depending on the dependence properties of bivariate copulas in joint tails. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulated data sets and a real data set. The experiments demonstrate that the vine copula regression method is superior to linear regression in making inferences with conditional heteroscedasticity.},

In particular, two DRL settings encountered in several applications are considered: multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and parallel RL, where frequent information exchanges between the learners and the controller are required. For many practical distributed systems, however, such as those involving parallel machines for training deep RL algorithms, and multi-robot systems for learning the optimal coordination strategies, the overhead caused by these frequent communication exchanges is considerable, and becomes the bottleneck of the overall performance. To address this challenge, a novel policy gradient method is developed here to cope with such communicationconstrained DRL settings. The proposed approach reduces the communication overhead without degrading learning performance by adaptively skipping the policy gradient communication during iterations. It is established analytically that i) the novel algorithm has convergence rate identical to that of the plain-vanilla policy gradient for DRL; while ii) if the distributed computing units are heterogeneous in terms of their reward functions and initial state distributions, the number of communication rounds needed to achieve a desirable learning accuracy is markedly reduced. Numerical experiments on a popular multi-agent RL benchmark corroborate the significant communication reduction attained by the novel algorithm compared to alternatives.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new class of gradient methods for distributed machine learning that adaptively skip the gradient calculations to learn with reduced communication and computation. Simple rules are designed to detect slowly-varying gradients and, therefore, trigger the reuse of outdated gradients. The resultant gradient-based algorithms are termed Lazily Aggregated Gradient — justifying our acronym LAG used henceforth. Theoretically, the merits of this contribution are: i) the convergence rate is the same as batch gradient descent in stronglyconvex, convex, and nonconvex cases; and, ii) if the distributed datasets are heterogeneous (quantified by certain measurable constants), the communication rounds needed to achieve a targeted accuracy are reduced thanks to the adaptive reuse of lagged gradients. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data corroborate a significant communication reduction compared to alternatives.},

For example, a set of key economic indicators are regularly reported in different countries every quarter. The observations at each quarter neatly form a matrix and are observed over many consecutive quarters. Dynamic transport networks with observations generated on the edges can be formed as a matrix observed over time. Although it is natural to turn the matrix observations into a long vector, and then use the standard vector time series models for analysis, it is often the case that the columns and rows of the matrix represent different types of structures that are closely interplayed. In this paper we follow the autoregressive structure for modeling time series and propose a novel matrix autoregressive model in a bilinear form that maintains and utilizes the matrix structure to achieve a greater dimensional reduction, as well as more interpretable results. Probabilistic properties of the models are investigated. Estimation procedures with their theoretical properties are presented and demonstrated with simulated and real examples.},

  abstract = {Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality since generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that may have never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We claim that validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated by a model. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic conditional and unconditional text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.},

The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system.

We show that the proposed framework suffers from several issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior related to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due to singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational Gaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that the algorithm still works only because the variational formulation annuls some of the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL) divergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of high-dimensional distributions. We show that motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit. Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically and on a simple practical example which shows that the QKLoptimal approximation of a full rank Gaussian with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal Component Analysis solution.},

On the basis of this analysis, we propose sigsoftmax, which is composed of a multiplication of an exponential function and sigmoid function. Sigsoftmax can break the softmax bottleneck.

Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator.

This paper outlines an optimization algorithm, Adaptive Stochastic Descent (ASD), that has been designed to replicate the essential aspects of manual parameter fitting in an automated way. Specifically, ASD uses simple principles to form probabilistic assumptions about (a) which parameters have the greatest effect on the objective function, and (b) optimal step sizes for each parameter. We show that for a certain class of optimization problems (namely, those with a moderate to large number of scalar parameter dimensions, especially if some dimensions are more important than others), ASD is capable of minimizing the objective function with far fewer function evaluations than classic optimization methods, such as the Nelder-Mead nonlinear simplex, Levenberg-Marquardt gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. As a case study, we show that ASD outperforms standard algorithms when used to determine how resources should be allocated in order to minimize new HIV infections in Swaziland.},

Classical model distance measures require multivariate integration and thus suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we provide numerically tractable methods to measure the distance between two vine copulas even in high dimensions. For this purpose, we consecutively develop three new distance measures based on the Kullback–Leibler distance, using the result that it can be expressed as the sum over expectations of KL distances between univariate conditional densities, which can be easily obtained for vine copulas. To reduce numerical calculations, we approximate these expectations on adequately designed grids, outperforming Monte Carlo integration with respect to computational time. For the sake of interpretability, we provide a baseline calibration for the proposed distance measures. We further develop similar substitutes for the Jeffreys distance, a symmetrized version of the Kullback–Leibler distance. In numerous examples and applications, we illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the developed distance measures.},

To address this difficulty, we propose a method to generate realistic synthetic PNRs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN applications, PNRs consist of categorical and numerical features with missing/NaN values, which makes the use of GANs challenging. We propose a solution based on Crame´r GANs, categorical feature embedding and a Cross-Net architecture. The method was tested on a real PNR dataset, and evaluated in terms of distribution matching, memorization, and performance of predictive models for two real business problems: client segmentation and passenger nationality prediction. Results show that the generated data matches well with the real PNRs without memorizing them, and that it can be used to train models for real business applications.},

Most approaches rely on the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution such as statistical models on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). They are based on modeling conditional independencies and are scalable to high dimensions. In contrast, vine copula models accommodate more elaborate features like tail dependence and asymmetry, as well as independent modeling of the marginals. This flexibility comes however at the cost of exponentially increasing complexity for model selection and estimation. We show a novel connection between DAGs with limited number of parents and truncated vine copulas under sufficient conditions. This motivates a more general procedure exploiting the fast model selection and estimation of sparse DAGs while allowing for non-Gaussian dependence using vine copulas. By numerical examples in hundreds of dimensions, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the standard method for vine structure selection.

Based on this assumption, a Gaussian likelihood can be constructed, where the mean and covariance matrix of the summary statistics are estimated via Monte Carlo. The objective of the current work is to improve on a variational implementation of the Bayesian synthetic likelihood introduced recently in the literature, to enable the application of that approach to high-dimensional problems. Here high-dimensional can mean problems with more than one hundred parameters. The improvements introduced relate to shrinkage estimation of covariance matrices in estimation of the synthetic likelihood, improved implementation of control variate approaches to stochastic gradient variance reduction, and parsimonious but expressive parametrizations of variational normal posterior covariance matrices in terms of factor structures to reduce the dimension of the optimization problem. The shrinkage covariance estimation is particularly important for stability of stochastic gradient optimization with noisy likelihood estimates. However, as the dimension increases, the quality of the posterior approximation deteriorates unless the number of Monte Carlo samples used to estimate the synthetic likelihood also increases. We explore the properties of the method in some real examples in cases where either the number of summary statistics, the number of model parameters, or both, are large.},

Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.},

The sampling algorithm relies on steps of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated with different modes. Besides, the method learns the optimal parameters of the algorithm while it runs, without requiring user intervention. Our technique should be considered as a flexible framework, in which the design of moves can follow various strategies known from the broad MCMC literature. In order to design an adaptive scheme that facilitates both local and jump moves, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing each mode and we define a new target distribution \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash pi\}\$ on an augmented state space \$\textbackslash mathcal\{X\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash times\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\$, where \$\textbackslash mathcal\{X\}\$ is the original state space of \$\textbackslash pi\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\$ is the set of the modes. As the algorithm runs and updates its parameters, the target distribution \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash pi\}\$ also keeps being modified. This motivates a new class of algorithms, Auxiliary Variable Adaptive MCMC. We prove general ergodic results for the whole class before specialising to the case of our algorithm.},

However, MCMC algorithms tend to be computationally demanding, and are particularly slow for large datasets. Data subsampling has recently been suggested as a way to make MCMC methods scalable on massively large data, utilizing efficient sampling schemes and estimators from the survey sampling literature. These developments tend to be unknown by many survey statisticians who traditionally work with non-Bayesian methods, and rarely use MCMC. Our article reviews Subsampling MCMC, a so called pseudo-marginal MCMC approach to speeding up MCMC through data subsampling. The review is written for a survey statistician without previous knowledge of MCMC methods since our aim is to motivate survey sampling experts to contribute to the growing Subsampling MCMC literature.},

This methodology has proven to be effective in analysing non-stationary and complex time series since it is a nonparametric method and do not require the classical assumptions over the stationarity or over the normality of the residuals. Although SSA have proved to provide advantages over traditional methods, the challenges that arise when long time series are considered, make the standard SSA very demanding computationally and often not suitable. In this paper we propose the randomized SSA which is an alternative to SSA for long time series without losing the quality of the analysis. The SSA and the randomized SSA are compared in terms of quality of the model fit and forecasting, and computational time. This is done by using Monte Carlo simulations and real data about the daily prices of five of the major world commodities.},

This article introduces a fast Rao–Blackwellized Monte Carlo samplingbased method for efficiently approximating selected elements of the covariance matrix. The variance and confidence bounds of the approximations can be precisely estimated without additional computational costs. Furthermore, a method that iterates over subdomains is introduced, and is shown to additionally reduce the approximation errors to practically negligible levels in an application on functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate and scaling the batch size B ∝ . Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient m and scale B ∝ 1/(1 − m), although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning.

This algorithm uses amortized inference in a deep generative model to perform joint posterior predictive inference of mini-batch gradient computation times in a compute cluster specific manner. Specifically, our algorithm mitigates the straggler effect in synchronous, gradient-based optimization by choosing an optimal cutoff beyond which mini-batch gradient messages from slow workers are ignored. The principle novel contribution and finding of this work goes beyond this by demonstrating that using the predicted run-times from a generative model of cluster worker performance improves over the static-cutoff prior art, leading to higher gradient computation throughput on large compute clusters. In our experiments we show that eagerly discarding the mini-batch gradient computations of stragglers not only increases throughput but sometimes also increases the overall rate of convergence as a function of wall-clock time by virtue of eliminating idleness.},

In this article, we propose fast subsampling algorithms to efficiently approximate the maximum likelihood estimate in logistic regression. We first establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a general subsampling algorithm, and then derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the asymptotic mean squared error of the resultant estimator. An alternative minimization criterion is also proposed to further reduce the computational cost. The optimal subsampling probabilities depend on the full data estimate, so we develop a two-step algorithm to approximate the optimal subsampling procedure. This algorithm is computationally efficient and has a significant reduction in computing time compared to the full data approach. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator from a two-step algorithm are also established. Synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed method. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Here we characterize the behavior of Bayesian model selection when the compared models are misspecified and demonstrate that when the models are nearly equally wrong, the method exhibits unpleasant polarized behaviors, supporting one model with high confidence while rejecting others. This provides an explanation for the empirical observation of spuriously high posterior probabilities in molecular phylogenetics.           ,              The Bayesian method is noted to produce spuriously high posterior probabilities for phylogenetic trees in analysis of large datasets, but the precise reasons for this overconfidence are unknown. In general, the performance of Bayesian selection of misspecified models is poorly understood, even though this is of great scientific interest since models are never true in real data analysis. Here we characterize the asymptotic behavior of Bayesian model selection and show that when the competing models are equally wrong, Bayesian model selection exhibits surprising and polarized behaviors in large datasets, supporting one model with full force while rejecting the others. If one model is slightly less wrong than the other, the less wrong model will eventually win when the amount of data increases, but the method may become overconfident before it becomes reliable. We suggest that this extreme behavior may be a major factor for the spuriously high posterior probabilities for evolutionary trees.

  abstract = {This article proposes a distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating Bayesian hierarchical models when the number of cross-sectional units is very large and the objects of interest are the unit-level parameters. The two-stage algorithm is asymptotically exact, retains the flexibility of a standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The algorithm constructs an estimator of the posterior predictive distribution of the unit-level parameters in the first stage, and uses the estimator as the prior distribution in the second stage for the unit-level draws. Both stages are embarrassingly parallel. The algorithm is demonstrated with simulated data from a hierarchical logit model and is shown to be faster and more efficient (in effective sample size generated per unit of computing) than a single machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. For a relatively small number of observations per crosssectional unit, the algorithm is both faster and has better mixing properties than the standard hybrid Gibbs sampler. We illustrate our approach with data on 1,100,000 donors to a charitable organization, and simulations with up to 100 million units.},

  abstract = {Learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequences is a notoriously difficult task. There are three major challenges: 1) complex dependencies, 2) vanishing and exploding gradients, and 3) efficient parallelization. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective RNN connection structure, the DILATEDRNN, which simultaneously tackles all of these challenges. The proposed architecture is characterized by multi-resolution dilated recurrent skip connections, and can be combined flexibly with diverse RNN cells. Moreover, the DILATEDRNN reduces the number of parameters needed and enhances training efficiency significantly, while matching state-of-the-art performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term dependencies. To provide a theory-based quantification of the architecture’s advantages, we introduce a memory capacity measure, the mean recurrent length, which is more suitable for RNNs with long skip connections than existing measures. We rigorously prove the advantages of the DILATEDRNN over other recurrent neural architectures. The code for our method is publicly available1.},

The method proposed uses hitherto unknown properties of the gradient of the underlying log-empirical-likelihood function. We use results from convex analysis to show that these properties hold under minimal assumptions on the parameter space, prior density and the functions used in the estimating equations determining the empirical likelihood. Our method employs a finite number of estimating equations and observations but produces valid semiparametric inference for a large class of statistical models including mixed effects models, generalized linear models and hierarchical Bayes models. We overcome major challenges posed by complex, non-convex boundaries of the support routinely observed for empirical likelihood which prevent efficient implementation of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods like randomwalk Metropolis–Hastings sampling etc. with or without parallel tempering. A simulation study confirms that our method converges quickly and draws samples from the posterior support efficiently. We further illustrate its utility through an analysis of a discrete data set in small area estimation.},

This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined, encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, with a challenging industrial application presented.},

We trained the presented TAC-GAN model on the Oxford102 dataset of flowers, and evaluated the discriminability of the generated images with Inception-Score, as well as their diversity using the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM). Our approach outperforms the stateof-the-art models, i.e., its inception score is 3.45, corresponding to a relative increase of 7.8\% compared to the recently introduced StackGan. A comparison of the mean MS-SSIM scores of the training and generated samples per class shows that our approach is able to generate highly diverse images with an average MS-SSIM of 0.14 over all generated classes.},

However, some applications require an extension to more general spaces. For example, phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees are defined in terms of both a discrete graph and associated continuous parameters; although one can represent these aspects using a single connected space, this rather complex space is not suitable for existing HMC algorithms. In this paper, we develop Probabilistic Path HMC (PPHMC) as a first step to sampling distributions on spaces with intricate combinatorial structure. We define PPHMC on orthant complexes, show that the resulting Markov chain is ergodic, and provide a promising implementation for the case of phylogenetic trees in opensource software. We also show that a surrogate function to ease the transition across a boundary on which the log-posterior has discontinuous derivatives can greatly improve efficiency.},

The model is analyzed from a Bayesian perspective and has the benefit of automatically down-weighting time points close to motion spikes in a data-driven manner. We develop a highly efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix) and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli, head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI data analysis. Our results show that the GLMH tends to detect more brain activity, compared to its homoscedastic counterpart, by allowing the variance to change over time depending on the degree of head motion.},

  abstract = {The general projected normal distribution is a simple and intuitive model for directional data in any dimension: a multivariate normal random vector divided by its length is the projection of that vector onto the surface of the unit hypersphere. Observed data consist of the projections, but not the lengths. Inference for this model has been restricted to the two-dimensional (circular) case, using Bayesian methods with data augmentation to generate the latent lengths and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to sample from the posterior. We describe a new parameterization of the general projected normal distribution that makes inference in any dimension tractable, including the important three-dimensional (spherical) case, which has not previously been considered. Under this new parameterization, the full conditionals of the unknown parameters have closed forms, and we propose a new slice sampler to draw the latent lengths without the need for rejection. Gibbs sampling with this new scheme is fast and easy, leading to improved Bayesian inference; for example, it is now feasible to conduct model selection among complex mixture and regression models for large data sets. Our parameterization also allows straightforward incorporation of covariates into the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal, increasing the ability of the model to explain directional data as a function of independent regressors. Circular and spherical cases are considered in detail and illustrated with scientific applications. For the circular case, seasonal variation in time-of-day departures of anglers from recreational fishing sites is modeled using covariates in both the mean vector and covariance matrix. For the spherical case, we consider paired angles that describe the relative positions of carbon atoms along the backbone chain of a protein. We fit mixtures of general projected normals to these data, with the best-fitting mixture accurately describing biologically meaningful structures including helices, β-sheets, and coils and turns. Finally, we show via simulation that our methodology has satisfactory performance in some 10-dimensional and 50-dimensional problems.},

We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking.

The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently on parallel processors. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the proposed estimators and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a highdimensional variable selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

  abstract = {We discuss efficient Bayesian estimation of dynamic covariance matrices in multivariate time series through a factor stochastic volatility model. In particular, we propose two interweaving strategies (Yu and Meng, 2011) to substantially accelerate convergence and mixing of standard MCMC approaches. Similar to marginal data augmentation techniques, the proposed acceleration procedures exploit non-identifiability issues which frequently arise in factor models. Our new interweaving strategies are easy to implement and come at almost no extra computational cost; nevertheless, they can boost estimation efficiency by several orders of magnitude as is shown in extensive simulation studies. To conclude, the application of our algorithm to a 26-dimensional exchange rate data set illustrates the superior performance of the new approach for real-world data.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

  abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image superresolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4× upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

This class of algorithms adopts a divide-and-conquer approach based upon an auxiliary tree-structured decomposition of the model of interest, turning the overall inferential task into a collection of recursively solved subproblems. The proposed method is applicable to a broad class of probabilistic graphical models, including models with loops. Unlike a standard SMC sampler, the proposed divideand-conquer SMC employs multiple independent populations of weighted particles, which are resampled, merged, and propagated as the method progresses. We illustrate empirically that this approach can outperform standard methods in terms of the accuracy of the posterior expectation and marginal likelihood approximations. Divide-and-conquer SMC also opens up novel parallel implementation options and the possibility of concentrating the computational effort on the most challenging subproblems. We demonstrate its performance on a Markov random field and on a hierarchical logistic regression problem.

Its fully automatic implementations have made HMC a standard tool for applied Bayesian modeling. While its performance is often superior to alternatives under a wide range of models, one prominent weakness of HMC is its inability to handle discrete parameters. In this article, we present discontinuous HMC, an extension that can efficiently explore discrete spaces involving ordinal parameters as well as target distributions with discontinuous densities. The proposed algorithm is based on two key ideas: embedding of discrete parameters into a continuous space and simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics on a piecewise smooth density function. When properly-tuned, discontinuous HMC is guaranteed to outperform a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm as the two algorithms coincide under a specific (and sub-optimal) implementation of discontinuous HMC. It is additionally shown that the dynamics underlying discontinuous HMC have a remarkable similarity to a zig-zag process, a continuous-time Markov process behind a state-of-the-art non-reversible rejection-free sampler. We apply our algorithm to challenging posterior inference problems to demonstrate its wide applicability and competitive performance.},

Specifically, we show that when the true conditional density has a certain smoothness level, then the posterior contraction rate around the truth is equal up to a log factor to the frequentist minimax rate of estimation. An extension to the case when the covariate space is unbounded is also established. As our result holds without a priori knowledge of the smoothness level of the true density, the established posterior contraction rates are adaptive. Moreover, we show that the rate is not affected by inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. In Monte Carlo simulations, a version of the model compares favorably to a cross-validated kernel conditional density estimator.},

Most of the currently proposed methods therefore do inference in subregions of the brain separately or do approximate inference without comparison to the true posterior distribution. A popular such method, which is now the standard method for Bayesian single subject analysis in the SPM software, is introduced in Penny et al. (2005b). The method processes the data slice-by-slice and uses an approximate variational Bayes (VB) estimation algorithm that enforces posterior independence between activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a fast and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for exact inference in the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole brain using a 3D prior on activity coefficients. The algorithm exploits sparsity and uses modern techniques for efficient sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, leading to speed-ups without which MCMC would not be a practical option. Using MCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate VB posterior against the exact MCMC posterior, and show that VB can lead to spurious activation. In addition, we develop an improved VB method that drops the assumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be much faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large datasets, with negligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.},

However, the existing VB algorithms are restricted to cases where the likelihood is tractable, which precludes their use in many interesting situations such as in state–space models and in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), where application of VB methods was previously impossible. This article extends the scope of application of VB to cases where the likelihood is intractable, but can be estimated unbiasedly. The proposed VB method therefore makes it possible to carry out Bayesian inference in many statistical applications, including state–space models and ABC. The method is generic in the sense that it can be applied to almost all statistical models without requiring too much model-based derivation, which is a drawback of many existing VB algorithms. We also show how the proposed method can be used to obtain highly accurate VB approximations of marginal posterior distributions. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

A highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to capture full model uncertainty by simulating from the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters and the binary variable selection indicators. Simulated regression data is used to demonstrate that the Rician model is able to detect the signal much more accurately than the traditionally used Gaussian model at low signal-to-noise ratios. Using a diffusion dataset from the Human Connectome Project, it is also shown that the commonly used approximate Gaussian noise model underestimates the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the single-diffusion tensor model compared to the Rician model.},

The model is very flexible since both the noise-free signal and the noise variance are functions of diffusion covariates, and the relevant covariates in the noise are automatically selected by Bayesian variable selection. We compare the estimated diffusion tensors from our model to a homoscedastic counterpart with no covariates in the noise, and to commonly used linear and nonlinear least squares methods. The estimated single-diffusion tensors within each voxel are compared with respect to fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Using data from the Human Connectome Project, our results show that the noise is clearly heteroscedastic, especially the posterior variance for MD is substantially underestimated by the homoscedastic model, and inferences from the homoscedastic model are on average spuriously precise. Inferences from commonly used ordinary and weighted least squares methods (OLS and WLS) show that it is not adequate to estimate the single-diffusion tensor from logarithmic measurements.},

However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X → Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y → X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to enforce F (G(X)) ≈ X (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

However, PLANET, the standard distributed tree learning algorithm implemented in systems such as XGBOOST and Spark MLLIB, scales poorly as data dimensionality and tree depths grow. We present YGGDRASIL, a new distributed tree learning method that outperforms existing methods by up to 24×. Unlike PLANET, YGGDRASIL is based on vertical partitioning of the data (i.e., partitioning by feature), along with a set of optimized data structures to reduce the CPU and communication costs of training. YGGDRASIL (1) trains directly on compressed data for compressible features and labels; (2) introduces efficient data structures for training on uncompressed data; and (3) minimizes communication between nodes by using sparse bitvectors. Moreover, while PLANET approximates split points through feature binning, YGGDRASIL does not require binning, and we analytically characterize the impact of this approximation. We evaluate YGGDRASIL against the MNIST 8M dataset and a high-dimensional dataset at Yahoo; for both, YGGDRASIL is faster by up to an order of magnitude.},

In the distributed sparse Gaussian mean estimation problem, each of the m machines receives n data points from a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with unknown mean θ which is promised to be k-sparse. The machines communicate by message passing and aim to estimate the mean θ. We provide a tight (up to logarithmic factors) tradeoff between the estimation error and the number of bits communicated between the machines. This directly leads to a lower bound for the distributed sparse linear regression problem: to achieve the statistical minimax error, the total communication is at least Ω(min\{n, d\}m), where n is the number of observations that each machine receives and d is the ambient dimension. These lower bound results improve upon Shamir (NIPS’14) and Steinhardt, Duchi (COLT’15) by allowing a multi-round interactive communication model. We also give the first optimal simultaneous protocol in the dense case for mean estimation.},

This problem is especially hard to solve for time series classification and regression in industrial applications such as predictive maintenance or production line optimization, for which each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously. Here, we are proposing an efficient, scalable feature extraction algorithm for time series, which filters the available features in an early stage of the machine learning pipeline with respect to their significance for the classification or regression task, while controlling the expected percentage of selected but irrelevant features. The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods with a feature importance filter. It has a low computational complexity, allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our proposed algorithm on all binary classification problems of the UCR time series classification archive as well as time series from a production line optimization project and simulated stochastic processes with underlying qualitative change of dynamics.},

  abstract = {In a multi-class classification problem, it is standard to model the output of a neural network as a categorical distribution conditioned on the inputs. The output must therefore be positive and sum to one, which is traditionally enforced by a softmax. This probabilistic mapping allows to use the maximum likelihood principle, which leads to the well-known log-softmax loss. However the choice of the softmax function seems somehow arbitrary as there are many other possible normalizing functions. It is thus unclear why the log-softmax loss would perform better than other loss alternatives. In particular Vincent et al. (2015) recently introduced a class of loss functions, called the spherical family, for which there exists an efficient algorithm to compute the updates of the output weights irrespective of the output size. In this paper, we explore several loss functions from this family as possible alternatives to the traditional log-softmax. In particular, we focus our investigation on spherical bounds of the log-softmax loss and on two spherical log-likelihood losses, namely the log-Spherical Softmax suggested by Vincent et al. (2015) and the log-Taylor Softmax that we introduce. Although these alternatives do not yield as good results as the log-softmax loss on two language modeling tasks, they surprisingly outperform it in our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10, suggesting that they might be relevant in a broad range of applications.},

Because the Chinese language differs most significantly from alphabet-based languages in not specifying word boundaries, most existing Chinese text-mining methods require a prespecified vocabulary and/or a large relevant training corpus, which may not be available in some applications. We introduce an unsupervised method, top-down word discovery and segmentation (TopWORDS), for simultaneously discovering and segmenting words and phrases from large volumes of unstructured Chinese texts, and propose ways to order discovered words and conduct higher-level context analyses. TopWORDS is particularly useful for mining online and domain-specific texts where the underlying vocabulary is unknown or the texts of interest differ significantly from available training corpora. When outputs from TopWORDS are fed into context analysis tools such as topic modeling, word embedding, and association pattern finding, the results are as good as or better than that from using outputs of a supervised segmentation method.},

We make two contributions. First, we show that competitive markets in which heterogeneous price-taker firms compete strategically by setting trade-credit maturities have a unique symmetric equilibrium in trade-terms and the equilibrium dictates the production flow along the supply chains. Secondly, we find that the network can have a role either as shock absorber or shock amplifier and this is determined by a testable condition which holds for a general class of trade-credit networks. On these grounds, we argue that the proportional credit rationing used by banks (i.e., richer borrowers obtain larger loans) may have ambiguous effects on systemic vulnerability. In fact, if for intermediate levels of bank-credit only a subset of firms substitute trade-credit in favor of bank-credit, the bank may worsen the quality of the inter-firm credit network, thus increasing the systemic vulnerability above the contagion threshold.},

In this paper, we develop a novel fully Bayesian approach that allows for rank estimation. The key to our approach is reparameterizing the coefficient matrix using its singular value decomposition and conducting Bayesian inference on the decomposed parameters. By implementing a stochastic search variable selection on the singular values of the coefficient matrix, the ultimate selected rank can be identified as the number of nonzero singular values. Our approach is appropriate for small multivariate regressions as well as for higher dimensional models with up to about 40 predictors. In macroeconomic forecasting using VARs, the advantages of shrinkage through proper Bayesian priors are well documented. Consequently, the shrinkage approach proposed here that selects or averages over low rank coefficient matrices is evaluated in a forecasting environment. We show in both simulations and empirical studies that our Bayesian approach provides forecasts that are highly competitive against two of the most promising benchmark methods, dynamic factor models and factor augmented VARs.},

  abstract = {Topic models, and more specifically the class of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are widely used for probabilistic modeling of text. MCMC sampling from the posterior distribution is typically performed using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We propose a parallel sparse partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and compare its speed and efficiency to state-of-the-art samplers for topic models on five well-known text corpora of differing sizes and properties. In particular, we propose and compare two different strategies for sampling the parameter block with latent topic indicators. The experiments show that the increase in statistical inefficiency from only partial collapsing is smaller than commonly assumed, and can be more than compensated by the speedup from parallelization and sparsity on larger corpora. We also prove that the partially collapsed samplers scale well with the size of the corpus. The proposed algorithm is fast, efficient, exact, and can be used in more modeling situations than the ordinary collapsed sampler.},

In this survey, we present some of the most widely used tensor decompositions, providing the key insights behind them, and summarizing them from a practitioner’s point of view. We then provide an overview of a very broad spectrum of applications where tensors have been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art performance, ranging from social network analysis to brain data analysis, and from web mining to healthcare. Subsequently, we present recent algorithmic advances in scaling tensor decompositions up to today’s big data, outlining the existing systems and summarizing the key ideas behind them.

We propose a new aggregation framework for intermittent demand forecasting that performs aggregation over the demand volumes, in contrast to the standard framework that employs temporal (over time) aggregation. To achieve this we construct a transformed time series, the inverse intermittent demand series. The new algorithm is expected to work best on erratic and lumpy demand, as a result of the variance reduction of the non-zero demands. The improvement in forecasting performance is empirically demonstrated through an extensive evaluation in more than 8000 time series of two well-researched spare parts data sets from the automotive and defence sectors. Furthermore, a simulation is performed so as to provide a stock-control evaluation. The proposed framework could find popularity among practitioners given its suitability when dealing with clump sizes. As such it could be used in conjunction with existing popular forecasting methods for intermittent demand as an exception handling mechanism when certain types of demand are observed.},

We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

The standard methods however quickly lose their effectiveness when the data are made up of structures of higher order than vectors, namely matrices or tensors (for example, images or videos), being unable to handle the high amounts of noise. Recently, an extension of the classic fourth order blind identification (FOBI) specially suited for tensor-valued observations was proposed and showed to outperform its vector version for tensor data. In this paper we extend another popular independent component analysis method, the joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices (JADE), for tensor observations. In addition to the theoretical background we also provide the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and use both simulations and real data to show its usefulness and superiority over its competitors.

The coefficients are estimated in the context of M-estimation. It is known that ordinary M-estimation leads to overfitting in nonlinear regression. The purpose of this paper is to construct a smooth estimator. The proposed method in this paper is conducted by a two-step procedure. First, the sufficient dimension reduction methods are applied to the response and radial basis functions for transforming the large number of radial bases to a small number of linear combinations of the radial bases without loss of information. In the second step, a multiple linear regression model between a response and the transformed radial bases is assumed and the ordinary Mestimation is applied. Thus, the final estimator is also obtained as a linear combination of radial bases. The validity and an asymptotic study of the proposed method are explored. A simulation and data example are addressed to confirm the behavior of the proposed method.},

Most high-dimensional tests for the equality of two mean vectors rely on naive diagonal or trace estimators of the covariance matrix, ignoring dependences between variables. A test using random subspaces is proposed, which offers higher power when the variables are dependent and is invariant under linear transformations of the marginal distributions. The p-values for the test are obtained using permutations. The test does not rely on assumptions about normality or the structure of the covariance matrix. It is shown by simulation that the new test has higher power than competing tests in realistic settings motivated by microarray gene expression data. Computational aspects of high-dimensional permutation tests are also discussed and an efficient R implementation of the proposed test is provided.},

The empirical application provides evidence of significant volatility and tail risk spillovers from the financial sector to many real sectors in the U.S. economy from 2001 to 2011. These spillovers increase in crisis periods. The CCX in a given sector is positively related to its amount of debt financing and negatively related to its valuation and investment. Therefore, real economy sectors—which require relatively high debt financing and whose value and investment activity are relatively lower—are prime candidates for stock price volatility and depreciation in the wake of a financial sector crisis. Evidence also suggests that the higher the industry’s degree of competition, the stronger the tail risk spillover from the financial sector.},

This paper identifies international contagion in banking during the 2007–2009 crisis for 54 economies. We identify three channels of contagion – systematic, idiosyncratic and volatility – and find evidence for these in 45 countries. Banking crises are overwhelmingly associated with the presence of both systematic and idiosyncratic contagion. The results reveal that crisis shocks transmitted from a foreign jurisdiction via idiosyncratic contagion increase the likelihood of a systemic crisis in the domestic banking system by almost 37 percent, whereas increased exposure via systematic contagion does not necessarily destabilize the domestic banking system. Thus while policy makers and regulatory authorities are rightly concerned with the systematic transmission of banking crises, reducing the potential for idiosyncratic contagion can importantly reduce the consequences for the domestic economy.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new framework to model and calibrate the process of firm value evolution when an unanticipated exogenous event impacting one firm can contagiously affect other firms. The nature of propagation of such contagion is determined by the underlying connections between firms, which can adversely affect the tail risks of firm value, hence the securities issued by the firm. This paper combines the insights gained from the existing firm-value models and historical events into a structural model for flow of contagion among firms using a network-based approach. Rather than using stylized networks, we develop a data-driven approach for network construction where we define and calibrate several contagion variables to model the spread of contagion. This framework is applied for assessing firm-level risk under downside risk measures. Using actual data, our model illustrates how connections between firms can lead to heavy-tailed default distributions and default clustering observed in practice.},

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple formula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponential family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

  abstract = {The traditional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is often of limited use in complex high-dimensional data due to the intractability of the underlying likelihood function. Maximum composite likelihood estimation (McLE) avoids full likelihood specification by combining a number of partial likelihood objects depending on small data subsets, thus enabling inference for complex data. A fundamental difficulty in making the McLE approach practicable is the selection from numerous candidate likelihood objects for constructing the composite likelihood function. In this paper, we propose a flexible Gibbs sampling scheme for optimal selection of sub-likelihood components. The sampled composite likelihood functions are shown to converge to the one maximally informative on the unknown parameters in equilibrium, since sub-likelihood objects are chosen with probability depending on the variance of the corresponding McLE. A penalized version of our method generates sparse likelihoods with a relatively small number of components when the data complexity is intense. Our algorithms are illustrated through numerical examples on simulated data as well as real genotype SNP data from a case-control study.},

In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects.

  abstract = {We present the parallel and interacting stochastic approximation annealing (PISAA) algorithm, a stochastic simulation procedure for global optimisation, that extends and improves the stochastic approximation annealing (SAA) by using population Monte Carlo ideas. The standard SAA algorithm guarantees convergence to the global minimum when a square-root cooling schedule is used; however the efficiency of its performance depends crucially on its self-adjusting mechanism. Because its mechanism is based on information obtained from only a single chain, SAA may present slow convergence in complex optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm involves simulating a population of SAA chains that interact each other in a manner that ensures significant improvement of the self-adjusting mechanism and better exploration of the sampling space. Central to the proposed algorithm are the ideas of (i) recycling information from the whole population of Markov chains to design a more accurate/stable self-adjusting mechanism and (ii) incorporating more advanced proposals, such as crossover operations, for the exploration of the sampling space. PISAA presents a significantly improved performance in terms of convergence. PISAA can be implemented in parallel computing environments if available. We demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithm on challenging applications including Bayesian network learning and protein folding. Our numerical comparisons suggest that PISAA outperforms the simulated annealing, stochastic approximation annealing, and annealing evolutionary stochastic approximation Monte Carlo especially in high dimensional or rugged scenarios.},

In this paper, we show that the slow rate is intrinsic to a broad class of M-estimators. In particular, for estimators based on minimizing a least-squares cost function together with a (possibly non-convex) coordinate-wise separable regularizer, there is always a “bad” local√optimum such that the associated prediction error is lower bounded by a constant multiple of 1/ n. For convex regularizers, this lower bound applies to all global optima. The theory is applicable to many popular estimators, including convex ℓ1-based methods as well as M-estimators based on nonconvex regularizers, including the SCAD penalty or the MCP regularizer. In addition, for a broad class of nonconvex regularizers, we show that the bad local optima are very common, in that a broad class of local minimization algorithms with random initialization will typically converge to a bad solution.},

  abstract = {Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is nontrivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers—including stochastic gradient versions—based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework. We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially “reinvented” in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC). Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.},

For each instantiation of u we run an optimization procedure to minimize the distance between summary statistics of the simulator and the data. After reweighing these samples using the prior and the Jacobian (accounting for the change of volume in transforming from the space of summary statistics to the space of parameters) we show that this weighted ensemble represents a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution.

Since the approach proposed has an embarrassingly parallel structure, it can be easily implemented in a parallel architecture and applied to big data problems with millions or more of explanatory variables. Under mild conditions, we show that the approach proposed is consistent, i.e. the true explanatory variables can be correctly identified by the approach as the sample size becomes large. Extensive comparisons of the approach proposed have been made with penalized likelihood approaches, such as the lasso, elastic net, sure independence screening and iterative sure independence screening. The numerical results show that the approach proposed generally outperforms penalized likelihood approaches: the models selected by the approach tend to be more sparse and closer to the true model.},

  abstract = {Joint modeling of multiple health related random variables is essential to develop an understanding for the public health consequences of an aging population. This is particularly true for patients suffering from multiple chronic diseases. The contribution is to introduce a novel model for multivariate data where some response variables are discrete and some are continuous. It is based on pair copula constructions (PCCs) and has two major advantages over existing methodology. First, expressing the joint dependence structure in terms of bivariate copulas leads to a computationally advantageous expression for the likelihood function. This makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for large multidimensional data sets. Second, different and possibly asymmetric bivariate (conditional) marginal distributions are allowed which is necessary to accurately describe the limiting behavior of conditional distributions for mixed discrete and continuous responses. The advantages and the favorable predictive performance of the model are demonstrated using data from the Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II).},

  abstract = {In economics, insurance and finance, value at risk (VaR) is a widely used measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability α, the 100α\% VaR is defined as a threshold loss value, such that the probability that the loss on the portfolio over the given time horizon exceeds this value is α. That is to say, it is a quantile of the distribution of the losses, which has both good analytic properties and easy interpretation as a risk measure. However, its extension to the multivariate framework is not unique because a unique definition of multivariate quantile does not exist. In the current literature, the multivariate quantiles are related to a specific partial order considered in Rn, or to a property of the univariate quantile that is desirable to be extended to Rn. In this work, we introduce a multivariate value at risk as a vector-valued directional risk measure, based on a directional multivariate quantile, which has recently been introduced in the literature. The directional approach allows the manager to consider external information or risk preferences in her/his analysis. We derive some properties of the risk measure and we compare the univariate VaR over the marginals with the components of the directional multivariate VaR. We also analyze the relationship between some families of copulas, for which it is possible to obtain closed forms of the multivariate VaR that we propose. Finally, comparisons with other alternative multivariate VaR given in the literature, are provided in terms of robustness.},

Our method uses copulas to augment the families of distributions used in mean-field and structured approximations. Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.},

  abstract = {Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally infeasible. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing step sizes. In [Teh et al., 2014], we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.},

There is an impressive amount of individual research projects examining the vulnerability of critical infrastructure network. However, there is little understanding of the totality of the contribution made by these projects and their interrelationships. This makes their review a difficult process for both new and established researchers in the field. To address this issue, a two-step literature review process is used to provide an overview of the vulnerability of the transportation network in terms of four main themes—research objective, transportation mode, disruption scenario, and vulnerability indicator—involving the analysis of related articles from 2001 to 2013. Two limitations of existing research are identified: (1) the limited amount of studies relating to multilayer transportation network vulnerability analysis, and (2) the lack of evaluation methods to explore the relationship between structure vulnerability and dynamical functional vulnerability. In addition to indicating that more attention needs to be paid to these two aspects in the future, the analysis provides a new avenue for the discovery of knowledge, as well as an improved understanding of transportation network vulnerability.

We estimate a simple version of the model using market equity returns data to analyze spillovers in the values at risk (VaR) between a market index and financial institutions. We construct impulse-response functions for the quantiles of a sample of 230 financial institutions around the world and study how financial institution-specific and system-wide shocks are absorbed by the system. We show how the long-run risk of the largest and most leveraged financial institutions is very sensitive to market wide shocks in situations of financial distress, suggesting that our methodology can prove a valuable addition to the traditional toolkit of policy makers and supervisors.},

Then we assume a multivariate normal linear model on the continuous vector comprised of continuous variables and those underlying normal variables for ordinal variables from multivariate probit models and for categorical variables from multinomial probit models. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate unknown parameters including regression parameters, cut-points for ordinal data from the multivariate probit models, and the covariance matrix encompassing both continuous variables and the underlying normal latent variables. Combining the continuous variables and the normal latent variables allows us to model combinations of continuous, ordinal, and categorical multivariate data simultaneously. The framework incorporates flexible priors for the covariance matrix, provides a foundation for inference about the underlying covariance structure, and imputes missing data where needed.

To study such scenarios, we define and study some refinements of the classical minimax risk that apply to distributed settings, comparing to the performance of estimators with access to the entire data. Lower bounds on these quantities provide a precise characterization of the minimum amount of communication required to achieve the centralized minimax risk. We study two classes of distributed protocols: one in which machines send messages independently over channels without feedback, and a second allowing for interactive communication, in which a central server broadcasts the messages from a given machine to all other machines. We establish lower bounds for a variety of problems, including location estimation in several families and parameter estimation in different types of regression models. Our results include a novel class of quantitative data-processing inequalities used to characterize the effects of limited communication.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient “turnkey” samplers.},

  abstract = {Significance             Clustering, in essence, was a tool for describing spatial characteristics in the objects of concern. However, from social to biological studies, researchers’ interests in temporal characteristics often rival their interests in spatial features. Previous efforts to incorporate time information into clustering primarily relied on coding the time information into similarity metrics, thus reducing the problem into the classical paradigm of spatial clustering. The limitation is that the clustering outcomes are often time invariant. Here, we initiate a class of statistical methods that simultaneously infer spatial and temporal groupings. Such methods explicitly model the time dependencies of clustering indices over time. Our method inferred three genes to be associated with the earliest cell fate decision, which was corroborated by experimental validations.           ,              Both spatial characteristics and temporal features are often the subjects of concern in physical, social, and biological studies. This work tackles the clustering problems for time course data in which the cluster number and clustering structure change with respect to time, dubbed time-variant clustering. We developed a hierarchical model that simultaneously clusters the objects at every time point and describes the relationships of the clusters between time points. The hidden layer of this model is a generalized form of branching processes. A reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was implemented for model inference, and a feature selection procedure was developed. We applied this method to explore an open question in preimplantation embryonic development. Our analyses using single-cell gene expression data suggested that the earliest cell fate decision could start at the 4-cell stage in mice, earlier than the commonly thought 8- to 16-cell stage. These results together with independent experimental data from single-cell RNA-seq provided support against a prevailing hypothesis in mammalian development.},

Our alternative to the traditional construction of Bayes factors or posterior probabilities of a model given the data is to consider the hypotheses or models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focuses on the probability or weight of a given hypothesis within the mixture model. We analyse the sensitivity of the posterior distribution of the weights induced by different priors on these quantities. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley–Jeffreys paradox. For example, a reference Beta B(a0, a0) prior on the mixture weights can be used for the common problem of testing two contrasting hypotheses or models. In this case the sensitivity of the posterior estimates of the weights to the choice of a0 vanishes as the sample size increases. We therefore advocate a default choice of a0 = 0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Similar results apply for testing more than two alternatives. Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.},

The main advantage of such a model is its parsimony, as the variances and covariances of a time series vector are governed by a low-dimensional common factor with the components following independent SV models. For high-dimensional problems of this kind, Bayesian MCMC estimation is a very efficient estimation method; however, it is associated with a considerable computational burden when the dimensionality of the data is moderate to large. To overcome this, we avoid the usual forward-filtering backward-sampling (FFBS) algorithm by sampling “all without a loop” (AWOL), consider various reparameterizations such as (partial) noncentering, and apply an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy (ASIS) for boosting MCMC estimation at a univariate level, which can be applied directly to heteroskedasticity estimation for latent variables such as factors. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the model to a vector of daily exchange rate data.},

In this paper, focusing on empirical risk minimization, or equivalently M-estimation, we study the statistical error incurred by this strategy. We consider two large-sample settings: First, a classical setting where the number of parameters \$p\$ is fixed, and the number of samples per machine \$n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$. Second, a high-dimensional regime where both \$p,n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$ with \$p/n \textbackslash to \textbackslash kappa \textbackslash in (0,1)\$. For both regimes and under suitable assumptions, we present asymptotically exact expressions for this estimation error. In the fixed-\$p\$ setting, under suitable assumptions, we prove that to leading order averaging is as accurate as the centralized solution. We also derive the second order error terms, and show that these can be non-negligible, notably for non-linear models. The high-dimensional setting, in contrast, exhibits a qualitatively different behavior: data splitting incurs a first-order accuracy loss, which to leading order increases linearly with the number of machines. The dependence of our error approximations on the number of machines traces an interesting accuracy-complexity tradeoff, allowing the practitioner an informed choice on the number of machines to deploy. Finally, we confirm our theoretical analysis with several simulations.},

Such sudden switches in dependence structures are studied using Markov switching regular vine copulas. These copulas allow for asymmetric dependencies and tail dependencies in high dimensional data. Methods for fast maximum likelihood as well as Bayesian inference are developed. The algorithms are validated in simulations and applied to financial data. The results show that regime switches are present in the dependence structure and that regime switching models provide tools for the accurate description of inhomogeneity during times of crisis.},

An appealing aspect of this approach is that computations are relatively easy. In this paper, we examine the predictive performance of these models with an increasing number of covariates. Even for a moderate number of covariates, we find that the likelihood for x tends to dominate the posterior of the latent random partition, degrading the predictive performance of the model. To overcome this, we suggest using a different nonparametric prior, namely an enriched Dirichlet process. Our proposal maintains a simple allocation rule, so that computations remain relatively simple. Advantages are shown through both predictive equations and examples, including an application to diagnosis Alzheimer’s disease.},

Moreover, the method can adapt to sparsity structure in which certain models should receive zero weights, and the method is tuning parameter free unlike competitors. More generally, under an Mopen view when the truth falls outside the space of all convex/linear combinations, our theory suggests that the posterior measure tends to concentrate on the best approximation of the truth at the minimax rate.

The model is implemented using an AR (p)-GARCH (1, 1)-t model for the marginal distributions and constant and time-varying copulas for the joint distribution. The results show that the dependence between crude oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock market returns is generally weak, that it was positive before the global financial crisis, except in Hong Kong, and that it increased significantly in the aftermath of the crisis. The lower tail dependence between oil prices and Asia-Pacific stock markets exceeds that of the upper tail dependence, except in Japan and Singapore in the post-crisis period. Moreover, we show that time-varying copulas best capture the tail dependence and that taking the tail correlation into account leads to improved accuracy of VaR estimates. These findings have important implications for investors interested in Asia-Pacific markets for portfolio diversification, risk management, and international asset allocation.},

We show that financial contagion exhibits a form of phase transition as interbank connections increase: as long as the magnitude and the number of negative shocks affecting financial institutions are sufficiently small, more “complete” interbank claims enhance the stability of the system. However, beyond a certain point, such interconnections start to serve as a mechanism for propagation of shocks and lead to a more fragile financial system. We also show that, under natural contracting assumptions, financial networks that emerge in equilibrium may be socially inefficient due to the presence of a network externality: even though banks take the effects of their lending, risk-taking and failure on their immediate creditors into account, they do not internalize the consequences of their actions on the rest of the network.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are widely used in nonparametric regression, classification and spatiotemporal modelling, facilitated in part by a rich literature on their theoretical properties. However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-ofregressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.},

Since multivariate copulae constructed through pair-copula decompositions were introduced to the statistical community, interest in these models has been growing steadily and they are finding successful applications in various fields. Research so far has however been concentrating on so-called canonical and D-vine copulae, which are more restrictive cases of regular vine copulae. It is shown how to evaluate the density of arbitrary regular vine specifications. This opens the vine copula methodology to the flexible modeling of complex dependencies even in larger dimensions. In this regard, a new automated model selection and estimation technique based on graph theoretical considerations is presented. This comprehensive search strategy is evaluated in a large simulation study and applied to a 16-dimensional financial data set of international equity, fixed income and commodity indices which were observed over the last decade, in particular during the recent financial crisis. The analysis provides economically well interpretable results and interesting insights into the dependence structure among these indices.},

To weaken the curse of dimensionality, instead of a full tensor spline basis, a reduced tensor product based on so called sparse grids (Notes Numer. Fluid Mech. Multidiscip. Des., 31, 1991, 241-251) is used. To achieve uniform margins of the copula density, linear constraints are placed on the spline coefficients, and quadratic programming is used to fit the model. Simulations and practical examples accompany the presentation.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = {Gaussian factor models have proven widely useful for parsimoniously characterizing dependence in multivariate data. There is a rich literature on their extension to mixed categorical and continuous variables, using latent Gaussian variables or through generalized latent trait models acommodating measurements in the exponential family. However, when generalizing to non-Gaussian measured variables the latent variables typically influence both the dependence structure and the form of the marginal distributions, complicating interpretation and introducing artifacts. To address this problem we propose a novel class of Bayesian Gaussian copula factor models which decouple the latent factors from the marginal distributions. A semiparametric specification for the marginals based on the extended rank likelihood yields straightforward implementation and substantial computational gains. We provide new theoretical and empirical justifications for using this likelihood in Bayesian inference. We propose new default priors for the factor loadings and develop efficient parameter-expanded Gibbs sampling for posterior computation. The methods are evaluated through simulations and applied to a dataset in political science. The models in this paper are implemented in the R package bfa.1 Jared S.

After creditors observe what occurs in a rollover game for a firm, they conjecture one another’s ‘‘type’’ or attitude toward the risk associated with the firm’s investment project. Creditors’ inference about one another’s type then influences their decision to lend to the next firm. By providing an analysis of the ‘‘incidence of failure’’ (the threshold for a liquidity crisis) for each firm, this paper demonstrates that the risk of contagion increases sharply if it originates ex ante from a firm facing a low probability of failure. In addition, the paper proposes some policy measures for mitigating the severity of contagion during a liquidity crisis.},

Although this model is a promising candidate for nonlinear multiple time series modeling, high dimensionality of the parameters and lack of method for computing the standard errors of estimates limit its application to real data. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a form of parameter constraints is introduced with an efficient EM algorithm for estimation. Second, an accurate method for computing standard errors is presented for the model with and without parameter constraints. Lastly, a hypothesis-testing approach based on likelihood ratio tests is proposed, which aids in the selection of unnecessary parameters and leads to the greater efficiency at the estimation. A case study employing U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates illustrates the applicability of the mixture vector autoregressive model with parameter constraints, and the importance of using a reliable method to compute standard errors.},

By leveraging the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem, we extend the SGLD algorithm so that at high mixing rates it will sample from a normal approximation of the posterior, while for slow mixing rates it will mimic the behavior of SGLD with a pre-conditioner matrix. As a bonus, the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of Fisher scoring (with stochastic gradients) and as such an efficient optimizer during burn-in.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the spread of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 from the financial sector to the real economy by examining ten sectors in 25 major developed and emerging stock markets. The analysis tests different channels of financial contagion across countries and sectors and finds that the crisis led to an increased co-movement of returns among financial sector stocks across countries and between financial sector stocks and real economy stocks. The results demonstrate that no country and sector was immune to the adverse effects of the crisis limiting the effectiveness of portfolio diversification. However, there is clear evidence that some sectors in particular Healthcare, Telecommunications and Technology were less severely affected by the crisis.},

Important inference summaries include point estimation, region estimation, and precise hypotheses testing. Those summaries may appropriately be described as the solution to specific decision problems which depend on the particular loss function chosen. The use of a continuous loss function leads to an integrated set of solutions where the same prior distribution may be used throughout. Objective Bayesian methods are those which use a prior distribution which only depends on the assumed model and the quantity of interest. As a consequence, objective Bayesian methods produce results which only depend on the assumed model and the data obtained. The combined use of the intrinsic discrepancy, an invariant information-based loss function, and appropriately defined reference priors, provides an integrated objective Bayesian solution to both estimation and hypothesis testing problems. The ideas are illustrated with a large collection of non-trivial examples.},

  abstract = {Penalized regression methods, such as L1 regularization, are routinely used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on optimality properties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm, sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale mixtures of Gaussians, facilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the corresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide precise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we demonstrate that most commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian Lasso, are suboptimal in high-dimensional settings. A new class of Dirichlet Laplace (DL) priors are proposed, which are optimal and lead to efficient posterior computation exploiting results from normalized random measure theory. Finite sample performance of Dirichlet Laplace priors relative to alternatives is assessed in simulations.},

We find that the nonbankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm’s bankruptcy filing announcement. This negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. Furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. Non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. There is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm.},

Inference for variable selection models is usually implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Because MCMC can impose a high computational cost in studies with a large number of variables, we assess an alternative to MCMC based on a simple variational approximation. Our aim is to retain useful features of Bayesian variable selection at a reduced cost. Using simulations designed to mimic genetic association studies, we show that this simple variational approximation yields posterior inferences in some settings that closely match exact values. In less restrictive (and more realistic) conditions, we show that posterior probabilities of inclusion for individual variables are often incorrect, but variational estimates of other useful quantities—including posterior distributions of the hyperparameters—are remarkably accurate. We illustrate how these results guide the use of variational inference for a genome-wide association study with thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables.},

From an initial sequence of distributions (πt) of interest, and a particular choice of ξ(θ), a free energy SMC sampler computes sequentially a sequence of biased distributions (π˜t) with the following properties: (a) the marginal distribution of ξ(θ) with respect to π˜t is approximatively uniform over a specified interval, and (b) π˜t and πt have the same conditional distribution with respect to ξ. We apply our methodology to mixture posterior distributions, which are highly multimodal. In the mixture context, forcing certain hyper-parameters to higher values greatly faciliates mode swapping, and makes it possible to recover a symetric output. We illustrate our approach with univariate and bivariate Gaussian mixtures and two real-world datasets.},

We compare the performance of the implied probability of default from our model to the expected default frequencies based on the Moody’s KMV model and agency credit ratings by constructing cumulative accuracy profiles (CAP) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We find that the probability of default estimates from our model are equal or superior to other credit risk measures studied based on CAP and ROC. In particular, during the subprime crisis our model surpassed credit ratings and matched or exceeded KMV in anticipating the magnitude of the crisis. We have also found some initial evidence that adding off-balance-sheet derivatives exposure improves the performance of the KMV model.},

  abstract = {High-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, typically used in genome-wide association studies with a trait of interest, provide estimates of genotypes for up to one million loci. Most genotype estimates are very accurate, but genotyping errors do occur and can influence test statistics, p-values and ranks. Some SNPs are harder to call than others due to probe properties and other technical/biological factors; uncertainties can be associated with features of interest. SNP- and case- specific genotype posterior probabilities are available, but they are typically not used or used only informally, for example by setting aside the most uncertain calls. To improve on these approaches we take full advantage of Bayesian structuring and develop an analytic framework that accommodates genotype uncertainties in case-control studies. We show that the power of a score test (and statistical information more generally) is directly a function of the correlation of the genotype probabilities with the true genotypes. We demonstrate that compared to picking a single AA, AB or BB genotype or to setting aside difficult calls, Bayesian structuring can substantially increase statistical information for detecting a true association and for ranking SNPs whether the ranking be frequentist or optimal Bayes.},

The generalized extreme value distribution is extended to incorporate the time-dependence using a state space representation where the state variables either follow an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process with innovations arising from a Gumbel distribution. Using a Bayesian approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo method where we exploit an accurate approximation of the Gumbel distribution by a ten-component mixture of normal distributions. The methodology is illustrated using extreme returns of daily stock data. The model is fitted to a monthly series of minimum returns and the empirical results support strong evidence of time-dependence among the observed minimum returns.},

Almost all previous analysis has focused upon continuous target densities. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimensionality d of the target densities converges to infinity. In particular, when the proposal variance is scaled by \$d\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to an appropriate Langevin diffusion process. Therefore optimizing the efficiency of the RWM algorithm is equivalent to maximizing the speed of the limiting diffusion. This leads to an asymptotic optimal acceptance rate of \$e\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$ (=0.1353) under quite general conditions. The results have major practical implications for the implementation of RWM algorithms by highlighting the detrimental effect of choosing RWM algorithms over Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithms.},

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a “black art” requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm’s generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

In the last few years there has been an explosion of literature in the climate change science where mostly heuristic methods of synthesizing multiple models’ output have been proposed, and the statistical literature is showing more involvement by our community as well of late.

More problematic are the restrictive assumptions that must be made when using max-stable processes to model dependence for spatial extremes: it must be assumed that the dependence structure of the observed extremes is compatible with a limiting model that holds for all events more extreme than those that have already occurred. This problem has long been acknowledged in the context of finite-dimensional multivariate extremes, in particular when data display dependence at observable levels, but are independent in the limit. We propose a flexible class of models that is suitable for such data in a spatial context. In addition, we consider the situation where the extremal dependence structure may vary with distance. We apply our models to spatially referenced significant wave height data from the North Sea, finding evidence that their extremal structure is not compatible with a limiting dependence model.},

However, such models often contain uncertain parameters which need to be estimated from experimental data. Parameter estimation for complex high-dimensional Markov process models using diverse, partial, noisy and poorly calibrated time-course experimental data is a challenging inferential problem, but a computationally intensive Bayesian approach turns out to be effective. The utility and addedvalue of the approach is demonstrated in the context of a stochastic model of a key cellular decision made by the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, using quantitative data from single-cell fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry experiments.},

  abstract = {Optimization of complex functions, such as the output of computer simulators, is a difficult task that has received much attention in the literature. A less studied problem is that of optimization under unknown constraints, i.e., when the simulator must be invoked both to determine the typical real-valued response and to determine if a constraint has been violated, either for physical or policy reasons. We develop a statistical approach based on Gaussian processes and Bayesian learning to both approximate the unknown function and estimate the probability of meeting the constraints. A new integrated improvement criterion is proposed to recognize that responses from inputs that violate the constraint may still be informative about the function, and thus could potentially be useful in the optimization. The new criterion is illustrated on synthetic data, and on a motivating optimization problem from health care policy.},

  abstract = {Flexibly modeling the response variance in regression is important for efficient parameter estimation, correct inference, and for understanding the sources of variability in the response. Our article considers flexibly modelling the mean and variance functions within the framework of double exponential regression models, a class of overdispersed generalized linear models. The most general form of our model describes the mean and dispersion parameters in terms of additive functions of the predictors. Each of the additive terms can be either null, linear, or a fully flexible smooth effect. When the dispersion model is null the mean model is linear in the predictors and we obtain a generalized linear model, whereas with a null dispersion model and fully flexible smooth terms in the mean model we obtain a generalized additive model. Whether or not to include predictors, whether or not to model their effects linearly or flexibly, and whether or not to model overdispersion at all is determined from the data using a fully Bayesian approach to inference and model selection. Model selection is accomplished using a hierarchical prior which has many computational and inferential advantages over priors used in previous empirical Bayes approaches to similar problems. We describe an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme and priors that make the estimation of the model practical with a large number of predictors. The methodology is illustrated using real and simulated data.},

Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

We propose an alternative, multiscale visualization technique, motivated by the scale–space approach in computer vision. In brief, our method also ‘connects the dots’ but uses a range of pens of varying thicknesses for this. The resulting multiscale map, which is termed the thick pen transform, corresponds to viewing the time series from a range of distances. We formally prove that the thick pen transform is a discriminatory statistic for two Gaussian time series with distinct correlation structures. Further, we show interesting possible applications of the thick pen transform to measuring cross-dependence in multivariate time series, classifying time series and testing for stationarity. In particular, we derive the asymptotic distribution of our test statistic and argue that the test is applicable to both linear and non-linear processes under low moment assumptions. Various other aspects of the methodology, including other possible applications, are also discussed.},

The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain.The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/ research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

While most of the existing methods allow some degree of correlations among predictors but do not consider these correlations for variable selection, our method accounts for correlations among the predictors in variable selection. Our correlationbased stochastic search (CBS) method, the hybrid-CBS algorithm, extends a popular search algorithm for high-dimensional data, the stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) method. Similar to SSVS, we search the space of all possible models using variable addition, deletion or swap moves. However, our moves through the model space are designed to accommodate correlations among the variables. We describe our approach for continuous, binary, ordinal, and count outcome data. The impact of choices of prior distributions and hyperparameters is assessed in simulation studies. We also examined the performance of variable selection and prediction as the correlation structure of the predictors varies. We found that the hybrid-CBS resulted in lower prediction errors and identified better the true outcome associated predictors than SSVS when predictors were moderately to highly correlated. We illustrate the method on data from a proteomic profiling study of melanoma, a type of skin cancer.},

In particular, we allow the dimension of time series N to be as large as, or even larger than, the length of observed time series T . The estimation of the factor loading matrix and the factor process itself is carried out via an eigenanalysis of a N × N nonnegative definite matrix. We show that when all the factors are strong in the sense that the norm of each column in the factor loading matrix is of the order N 1/2, the estimator of the factor loading matrix is weakly consistent in L2-norm with the convergence rate independent of N . Thus the curse is cancelled out by the blessing of dimensionality. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators when factors are not strong. The proposed method together with the asymptotic properties are illustrated in a simulation study. An application to an implied volatility data set, with a trading strategy derived from the fitted factor model, is also reported.},

Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al., 2008), we now present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

  abstract = {Copula models have become one of the most widely used tools in the applied modelling of multivariate data. Similarly, Bayesian methods are increasingly used to obtain efficient likelihood-based inference. However, to date, there has been only limited use of Bayesian approaches in the formulation and estimation of copula models. This article aims to address this shortcoming in two ways. First, to introduce copula models and aspects of copula theory that are especially relevant for a Bayesian analysis. Second, to outline Bayesian approaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages over alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas constructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as transformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for Bayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes for fitting Gaussian and D-vine copulas, with and without selection, are given in detail. The relationship between the prior for the parameters of a D-vine, and the prior for a correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula, is discussed. Last, it is shown how to compute Bayesian inference when the data are discrete-valued using data augmentation. This approach generalises popular Bayesian methods for the estimation of models for multivariate binary and other ordinal data to more general copula models. Bayesian data augmentation has substantial advantages over other methods of estimation for this class of models.},

The basic idea is that parameters are endowed with distributions which may themselves introduce new parameters, and this construction recurses. In this review we discuss the role of hierarchical modeling in Bayesian nonparametrics, focusing on models in which the infinite-dimensional parameters are treated hierarchically. For example, we consider a model in which the base measure for a Dirichlet process is itself treated as a draw from another Dirichlet process. This yields a natural recursion that we refer to as a hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discuss hierarchies based on the Pitman-Yor process and on completely random processes. We demonstrate the value of these hierarchical constructions in a wide range of practical applications, in problems in computational biology, computer vision and natural language processing.},

  abstract = {To find the best forecasting model, several methods are usually tried on training dataset and the best one is selected to forecast the testing dataset. In this paper, we propose a model which selects a forecasting method based on its previous performance on similar dataset assuming that we have historical database of predictor’s performance. Thus, we need to obtain the characteristics of time series for similarity measure. Since not all of time series characteristics may necessarily be used to identify certain time series, we reduce the dimensionality of those characteristics using Principal Component Analysis. We use diverse forecasting methods ranging from simple to sophisticated ones, measure as Random Walk, ARIMA, interpolation, S-curve, and Multiple Kernel Learning. To cope with large dataset, we utilize clustering and similarity measure to select only a subset of training dataset. We use the 3003 dataset from M3 competition to construct the historical database which acts as training dataset and 111 from the M1 competition as testing dataset. Our experimental results indicate that our model selection may perform well compared to each individual predictor. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to select suitable predictors without trying all of them on current dataset.},

We apply the framework to euro area sovereign CDS spreads from 2008 to mid-2011. Our results reveal significant time-variation in distress dependence and considerable spill-over effects in the likelihood of sovereign default. We also investigate distress dependence around a policy announcement on May 9, 2010, and demonstrate the importance of capturing higher-order time-varying moments during times of crisis for the correct assessment of interacting risks.},

However, most document collections often come as temporal streams and thus several aspects of the latent structure such as the number of topics, the topics’ distribution and popularity are time-evolving. Several models exist that model the evolution of some but not all of the above aspects. In this paper we introduce infinite dynamic topic models, iDTM, that can accommodate the evolution of all the aforementioned aspects. Our model assumes that documents are organized into epochs, where the documents within each epoch are exchangeable but the order between the documents is maintained across epochs. iDTM allows for unbounded number of topics: topics can die or be born at any epoch, and the representation of each topic can evolve according to a Markovian dynamics. We use iDTM to analyze the birth and evolution of topics in the NIPS community and evaluated the efficacy of our model on both simulated and real datasets with favorable outcome.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization methods are often used to optimize unknown functions that are costly to evaluate. Typically, these methods sequentially select inputs to be evaluated one at a time based on a posterior over the unknown function that is updated after each evaluation. In many applications, however, it is desirable to perform multiple evaluations in parallel, which requires selecting batches of multiple inputs to evaluate at once. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to batch Bayesian optimization, providing a policy for selecting batches of inputs with the goal of optimizing the function as efficiently as possible. The key idea is to exploit the availability of high-quality and efficient sequential policies, by using Monte-Carlo simulation to select input batches that closely match their expected behavior. Our experimental results on six benchmarks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms two baselines and can lead to large advantages over a top sequential approach in terms of performance per unit time.},

Linear correlation is a natural dependence measure for multivariate normally and, more generally, elliptically distributed risks but other dependence concepts like comonotonicity and rank correlation should also be understood by the risk management practitioner. Using counterexamples the falsity of some commonly held views on correlation is demonstrated; in general, these fallacies arise from the naive assumption that dependence properties of the elliptical world also hold in the non-elliptical world. In particular, the problem of finding multivariate models which are consistent with prespecified marginal distributions and correlations is addressed. Pitfalls are highlighted and simulation algorithms avoiding these problems are constructed.},

We use bonds’ excess credit spread as a proxy for stocks’ default risk to control for the changing non-diversifiable option-risk characteristic of stocks. Because sensitivity to the excess credit spread becomes smaller as size increases and as value decreases, excess credit spread explains the CAPM anomalies in a fashion similar to the Fama–French factors. While the excess credit spread is significant in explaining Fama and French’s size and value effects, adding the Fama–French factors does not improve the performance of our model. Our revised model resembles conditional CAPM, but it offers a more intuitive explanation for the size and value effects.},

The method relies on a time change result for counting processes. With an almost identical set of default histories recorded by Moody’s in the period from 1982 to 2006, but using a different specification of the default intensity, we cannot reject the tests based on time change used in DDKS. We then note that the method proposed by DDKS is mainly a misspecification test in that it has very limited power in detecting violations of the doubly stochastic assumption. For example, it will not detect contagion which spreads through the explanatory variables ‘‘covariates” that determine the default intensities of individual firms. Therefore, we perform a different test using a Hawkes process alternative to see if firm-specific variables are affected by occurrences of defaults, but find no evidence of default contagion.},

  abstract = {Many popular estimators for duration models require independent competing risks or independent censoring. In contrast, copula-based estimators are also consistent in the presence of dependent competing risks. We suggest a computationally convenient extension of the copula graphic estimator to a model with more than two dependent competing risks. We analyse the applicability of this estimator by means of simulations and unemployment duration data from Germany. We obtain evidence that our estimator yields nice results if the dependence structure is known and that it is a powerful tool for the assessment of the relevance of (in-)dependence assumptions in applied duration research.},

By revealing information on a common fundamental factor and thereby affecting the behavior of creditors, the failure of a single firm can trigger the failure of another firm. The model provides a unique equilibrium framework to assess the consequences of contagion and yields some hitherto unnoticed insights. While contagion increases the correlation among the financial failures of different firms, its impact on the incidence of failure is ambiguous. I consider an analytically tractable version of the model in which the effect on the ex ante failure probabilities is exactly zero. Moreover, the impact of contagion increases with the relevance of a common underlying fundamental, but is limited to firms near the brink of success or failure.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback–Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.},

We introduce binary indicators to denote whether there is symmetry, or skew, in each dimension. We adopt a proper beta prior on each non-zero skew coefficient, and derive the corresponding prior on the skew parameters. In both distributions we show that as the degrees of freedom increases, the prior smoothly bounds the non-zero skew parameters away from zero and identifies the posterior. We estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by exploiting the conditionally Gaussian representation of the skew t distributions. This allows for the search through the posterior space of all possible combinations of skew and symmetry in each dimension. We show that the proposed method works well in a simulation setting, and employ it in two multivariate econometric examples. The first involves the modeling of foreign exchange rates and the second is a vector autoregression for intra-day electricity spot prices. The approach selects skew along the original coordinates of the data, which proves insightful in both examples.},

We also introduce a refinement of the random walk proposal which performs better for multimodal target distributions. We compare the sampling schemes using challenging but realistic models and priors applied to real data examples. The results show that for the examples studied, the adaptive independent Metropolis-Hastings proposals are much more efficient than the adaptive random walk proposals and that in general the copula based proposal has the best acceptance rates and lowest inefficiencies.},

Thus, Phase LIB trials are inherently comparative even though a standard therapy arm usually is not included. Uncertainty regarding the response rate Os of S is rarely made explicit, either in planning the trial or interpreting its results. We propose practical Bayesian guidelines for deciding whether E is promising relative to S in settings where patient response is binary and the data are monitored continuously. The design requires specification of an informative prior for Os, a targ improvement for E, and bounds on the allowed sample size. No explicit specification of a loss function is required. Sampling continues until E is shown to be either promising or not promising relative to S with high posterior probability, or the maximum sample size is reached. The design provides decision boundaries, a probability distribution for the sample size at termination, and operating characteristics under fixed response probabilities with E.},

Granger-causality tests reveal that the industry of business supplies and the industry of finance are the most important lead indicators of industry volatilities. To uncover contemporaneous causal relationships in the market, we implement an emerging data-driven method of directed acyclic graphs. The results suggest that volatility shocks originating from business supplies, machinery, and consumer goods industries are sources of risks that affect most other industries. By contrast, volatilities in the two traditionally important industries, oil and autos, do not appear to have a substantial influence on other large industries in the contemporaneous time. Finally, business equipment and services, both containing information technology components, are the most important driving forces of the industry volatility surge in the late 1990s.},

We focus on the roles industry specialization of auditors and the geography of clients’ audit offices play in accounting for the contagion. Our results are supportive of investors who differentiate audit practices by industry and who account for the location of the specific office where the audit work is done. We find that losses suffered by energy firms or firms located close to Houston are equivalent to approximately 90\% of the aggregate abnormal losses suffered by Big 5 clients.

The models are applied to wind speed records obtained from four potential wind generation sites in North Dakota. The forecasted wind speeds are used in conjunction with the power curve of an operational (NEG MICON, 750 kW) turbine to obtain corresponding forecasts of wind power production. The forecast errors in wind speed/power are analyzed and compared with the persistence model. Results indicate that significant improvements in forecasting accuracy are obtained with the proposed models compared to the persistence method.},

Thirdly and most importantly, we are able to analyze the impact of contagion on an investor’s demand for corporate bonds.

We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

In this paper, we introduce a supervised singular value decomposition technique as a data reduction step of independent component analysis (ICA), which is an effective tool for exploring spatio-temporal features in fMRI data. Two major advantages are discussed: first, the proposed method improves the robustness of ICA against spikes; second, the method uses the fMRI experimental designs to guide the fully data-driven ICA, yielding a more computationally efficient procedure and highly interpretable results. The advantages are demonstrated using spatio-temporal simulation studies as well as a data analysis.},

  abstract = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodelbased exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (q-EI), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the q-EI is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the q-EI, and apply them to Gaussian Processes and to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q ∈ [1, 10]).},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

Methods are employed to ensure that the approximating likelihood is continuous as a function of the unknown parameters thus enabling the use of Newton-Raphson type maximization algorithms. Our approach is robust and efficient relative to alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes employed in such contexts. The technique is applied to daily returns data for various stock price indices. We find strong evidence in favour of a leverage effect in all cases.

We then compute a distance between each posterior and the parametric prior, defined in terms of the curvature of the logarithm of each distribution, and the posterior minimizing the distance defines the effective sample size of the prior. For cases where the distance cannot be computed analytically, we provide a numerical approximation based on Monte Carlo simulation. We provide general guidelines for application, illustrate the method in several standard cases where the answer seems obvious, and then apply it to some nonstandard settings.},

In this paper we capture these characteristics using a first order vector autoregressive model with exogenous effects and a skew t distributed disturbance. The vector is longitudinal, in that it comprises observations on the spot price at intervals during a day. A band two inverse scale matrix is employed for the disturbance, as well as a sparse autoregressive coefficient matrix. This corresponds to a parsimonious dependency structure that directly relates an observation to the two immediately prior, and the observation at the same time the previous day. We estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which allows for the evaluation of the complete predictive distribution of future spot prices. We apply the model to hourly Australian electricity spot prices observed over a three year period, with four different nested multivariate error distributions: skew t, symmetric t, skew normal and symmetric normal. The forecasting performance is judged over a 30 day forecast trial using the continuous ranked probability score, which accounts for both predictive bias and sharpness.},

Each function is written as a linear combination of basis terms, with coefficients regularized by a proper linearly constrained Gaussian prior. Given any potentially rank deficient prior precision matrix, we show how to derive linear constraints so that the corresponding effect is identified in the additive model. This allows for the use of a wide range of bases and precision matrices in priors for regularization. By introducing indicator variables, each constrained Gaussian prior is augmented with a point mass at zero, thus allowing for function selection. Posterior inference is calculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo and the smoothness in the functions is both the result of shrinkage through the constrained Gaussian prior and model averaging. We show how using non-degenerate priors on the shrinkage parameters enables the application of substantially more computationally efficient sampling schemes than would otherwise be the case. We show the favourable performance of our approach when compared to two contemporary alternative Bayesian methods. To highlight the potential of our approach in high-dimensional settings we apply it to estimate two large seemingly unrelated regression models for intra-day electricity load. Both models feature a variety of different univariate and bivariate functions which require different levels of smoothing, and where component selection is meaningful. Priors for the error disturbance covariances are selected carefully and the empirical results provide a substantive contribution to the electricity load modelling literature in their own right.},

To discover potential biomarkers from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method, we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold. Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

Bayesian approaches are ideal for earlier phase trials as they take into account information that accrues during a trial. Predictive probabilities are then updated and so become more accurate as the trial progresses. Suitable priors can act as pseudo samples, which make small sample clinical trials more informative. Thus patients have better chances to receive better treatments. The goal of this paper is to provide a tutorial for statisticians who use Bayesian methods for the first time or investigators who have some statistical background.

Positive correlations across CDS spreads imply that contagion effects dominate, whereas negative correlations indicate competition effects. We find strong evidence of contagion effects for Chapter 11 bankruptcies and competition effects for Chapter 7 bankruptcies. We also introduce a purely unanticipated event, in the form of a large jump in a company’s CDS spread, and find that this leads to the strongest evidence of credit contagion across the industry. These results have important implications for the construction of portfolios with creditsensitive instruments.},

This interrelationship generally fails as soon as there are discontinuities in the marginal distribution functions. In this paper, we consider an alternative transformation of an arbitrary random variable to a uniformly distributed one. Using this technique, the class of all possible copulas in the general case is investigated. In particular, we show that one of its members—the standard extension copula introduced by Schweizer and Sklar—captures the dependence structures in an analogous way the unique copula does in the continuous case. Furthermore, we consider measures of concordance between arbitrary random variables and obtain generalizations of Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho that correspond to the sample version of these quantities for empirical distributions.},

Our approach approximates full posterior distributions over model parameters and structures, as well as latent variables, in an analytical manner. These posteriors fall out of a free-form optimization procedure, which naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally nonGaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation.},

For sample sizes of 10 to 50, I examined the performance of methods for adjusting confidence intervals of the mean and parameters of a linear regression for autocorrelation. Similar analyses are common in econometric studies, and serious concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the common adjustment approaches, especially for estimating the slope of a linear regression when the explanatory variable has a time trend. Use of a bias-corrected estimate of the autocorrelation, either in an adjusted t test or in a two-stage approach, outperformed other methods, including maximum likelihood and bootstrap estimators, in terms of confidence interval coverage. The bias correction was, however, sometimes awkward to apply. It was generally better to test for autocorrelation at the 0.5 level and use ordinary least squares if the test was not significant, although this pretesting mainly helped for weak autocorrelation and small sample sizes. For the best methods, the coverage was sometimes still substantially less than the stated 95\% when autocorrelation was strong, even for sample sizes as large as 50. This was true for estimates of the mean, the regression intercept, and, when the explanatory variable had a time trend, the slope. Simulation results and an example show that different adjustment methods can produce substantially different estimates and confidence intervals. Cautious interpretation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is recommended.},

This nonparametric prior allows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation.

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

  abstract = {A drawback of available portfolio credit risk models is that they fail to allow for default risk dependency across loans other than through common risk factors. Thereby, these models ignore that close ties can exist between companies due to legal, financial and business relations. In this paper, we integrate the insights from theoretical models of default correlation into a commonly used model of default and portfolio credit risk by explicitly allowing for dependencies between firm defaults through both common factors and industry specific disturbances in a duration model. An application using pooled data from two Swedish banks’ business loan portfolios over the period 1994-2000 shows that estimates of individual default risk are little affected by including industry specific errors. However, accounting for the within-industry correlation of defaults increases estimates of VaR by 50-200 percent. We show that the model we propose manages to follow both the trend in credit losses and produce industry driven, time-varying, fluctuations in losses around that trend. A conventional model that contains only systematic factors as drivers of default correlation, although able to fit the broad trends in credit losses, cannot match these fluctuations because it fails to capture credit losses in bad times, when banks are typically hit by large unexpected credit losses. The model developed here should thus aid banks and supervisors in determining the appropriate size of economic capital requirements. Our estimations show that it is likely that banks need larger capital buffers than conventional models indicate.},

Agents are linked by productive and credit relationships so that the behavior of one agent influences the behavior of the others through network connections. Credit interlinkages among agents are a source of bankruptcy diffusion: in fact, failure of fulfilling debt commitments would lead to bankruptcy chains. All in all, the bankruptcy in one sector can diffuse to other sectors through linkages creating a vicious cycle and bankruptcy avalanches in the network economy. Our analysis show how the choices of credit supply by both banks and firms are interrelated. While the initial impact of monetary policy is on bank behaviour, we show the interactive play between the choices made by banks, the choices made by firms in their role as providers of credit, and the choices made by firms in their role as producers.},

  abstract = {Linear correlation is only an adequate means of describing the dependence between two random variables when they are jointly elliptically distributed. When the joint distribution of two or more variables is not elliptical the linear correlation coefficient becomes just one of many possible ways of summarising the dependence structure between the variables. In this paper we make use of a theorem due to Sklar (1959), which shows that an n-dimensional distribution function may be decomposed into its n marginal distributions, and a copula, which completely describes the dependence between the n variables. We verify that Sklar's theorem may be extended to conditional distributions, and apply it to the modelling of the time-varying joint distribution of the Deutsche mark - U.S. dollar and Yen - U.S. dollar exchange rate returns. We find evidence that the conditional dependence between these exchange rates is time-varying, and that it is asymmetric: dependence is greater during appreciations of the U.S. dollar against the mark and the yen than during depreciations of the U.S. dollar. We also find strong evidence of a structural break in the conditional copula following the introduction of the euro.},

A single common factor accounts for more than 50\% of all (but two) of the firms’ credit risk levels, with an average of 68\% across firms.

The "relative nonlinearity" is defined as the dimensional nonlinearity divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum assayed values. These definitions may be used to develop practical criteria for linearity that are still objective. Calculation of the nonlinearity requires a method of curve-fitting. In this article, we use polynomial regression to demonstrate calculations, but the definition of nonlinearity also accommodates alternative nonlinear regression procedures.},

We show that the problem of multivariate conditional variance estimation can be simplified by estimating univariate GARCH models for each asset, and then, using transformed residuals resulting from the first stage, estimating a conditional correlation estimator. The standard errors for the first stage parameters remain consistent, and only the standard errors for the correlation parameters need be modified. We use the model to estimate the conditional covariance of up to 100 assets using S\&P 500 Sector Indices and Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and conduct specification tests of the estimator using an industry standard benchmark for volatility models. This new estimator demonstrates very strong performance especially considering ease of implementation of the estimator.},

Due to the cost of microarray experiments, and also in some cases the limited availability of biological material, about 80\% of microarray time series experiments are short (3–8 time points). Previously short time series gene expression data has been mainly analyzed using more general gene expression analysis tools not designed for the unique challenges and opportunities inherent in short time series gene expression data. Results: We introduce the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) the first software program specifically designed for the analysis of short time series microarray gene expression data. STEM implements unique methods to cluster, compare, and visualize such data. STEM also supports efficient and statistically rigorous biological interpretations of short time series data through its integration with the Gene Ontology. Conclusion: The unique algorithms STEM implements to cluster and compare short time series gene expression data combined with its visualization capabilities and integration with the Gene Ontology should make STEM useful in the analysis of data from a significant portion of all microarray studies.

Cyclical correlation is due to the dependence of firms on common economic factors. Contagion is associated with the local interaction of firms with their business partners. We provide an explicit normal approximation of the distribution of portfolio losses. We quantify the relation between the variability of global economic fundamentals, strength of local firm interaction, and the fluctuation of losses. We find that cyclical oscillations in fundamentals dominate average losses, while local interaction causes additional fluctuations of losses around their average. The strength of the contagion-induced loss variability depends on the complexity of the business partner network.},

This article proposes a reduced-form model for these contagion phenomena, assuming they are due to the local interaction of firms in a business partner network. We study aggregate credit losses on large portfolios of financial positions contracted with firms subject to credit contagion. In particular, we provide an explicit Gaussian approximation of the distribution of portfolio losses. This enables us to quantify the relation between the volatility of losses and the determinants of credit contagion. We find that contagion processes have typically a secondorder effect on portfolio losses.

This strategy preserves the exchangeability of the rows of matrices. We define several simple generative processes that result in the same distribution over equivalence classes of binary matrices, one of which we call the Indian buffet process. We illustrate the use of this distribution as a prior in an infinite latent feature model, deriving a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model and applying this algorithm to an artificial dataset.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates how to apply the method of coupling from the past (CFTP) (Propp and Wilson, 1996) to the problem of sampling orthogonal predictors in the Bayes linear model. Using CFTP we construct a coupled Gibbs sampler that automatically determines its own run time to convergence. This removes the need to rely on approximate convergence diagnostics as in usual Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We apply this approach to a number of curve and surface tting examples using wavelets and Demmler-Reinsch smoothing splines where there are as many predictors as data points. The DemmlerReinsch splines are derived from an orthogonalization of some standard smoothing models. Somewhat remarkably, this procedure actually adds to the transparency of the model. This proves especially bene cial in a Bayesian perspective as it facilitates the quanti cation of prior beliefs on the model space. A striking result in all of our examples is the rapid convergence of the Gibbs sampler. Possessing this knowledge allows us to repeatedly regenerate the sampler following known convergence and hence generate independent and identically distributed samples from the posterior model space.},

The method is empirically compared with the revised simplex search, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, and the DIRECT methods using six test problems from the literature. An application case study on an inventory system is also documented.

When returns are non-normal, it is often simply impossible to specify the multivariate distribution relating two or more return series. In this context, we propose a new methodology based on copula functions, which consists in estimating first the univariate distributions and then the joining distribution. In such a context, the dependency parameter can easily be rendered conditional and time varying. We apply this methodology to the daily returns of four major stock markets. Our results suggest that conditional dependency depends on past realizations for European market pairs only. For these markets, dependency is found to be more widely affected when returns move in the same direction than when they move in opposite directions. Modeling the dynamics of the dependency parameter also suggests that dependency is higher and more persistent between European stock markets.},

  abstract = {Various economic theories are available to explain the existence of credit and default cycles. There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macroeconomic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933–1997 US data on real GDP, credit spreads and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit and business cycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, corresponding to periods of around 6 and 11–16 years, respectively. Cyclical co-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at the longer frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicality is less clearcut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive and negative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. This pattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World War II period. We comment on the implications of our findings for credit risk management. Copyright  2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We derive the optimal group composition as a function of predictive accuracy, between- and within-type covariance, and group size. Group size plays a critical role in determining the optimal group: in small groups the most accurate type should be in the majority, whereas in large groups the type with the least within-type covariance should dominate.

Exploring the analogy to a lattice gas model from physics, correlations between sequential defaults are modeled as due to functionally defined, heterogeneous couplings between mutually dependent counterparties. We show that—already for moderate micro-economic dependencies—counterparty risk results in a fattening of the tails in the portfolio loss distribution. In particular, for stronger mutually supportive relationship between the firms, collective phenomena such as bursts and avalanches of defaults can be observed in the model. In this context, traditional credit risk models are inadequate because they underestimate the required capital buffer. Our model setting is particularly applicable for doing stress analyses of credit risk in loan portfolios.},

  abstract = {Value at Risk (VaR) plays a central role in risk management. There are several approaches for the estimation of VaR, such as historical simulation, the variance-covariance (also known as analytical), and the Monte Carlo approaches. Whereas the first approach does not assume any distribution, the last two approaches demand the joint distribution to be known, which in the analytical approach is frequently the normal distribution. The copula theory is a fundamental tool in modeling multivariate distributions. It allows the definition of the joint distribution through the marginal distributions and the dependence between the variables. Recently the copula theory has been extended to the conditional case, allowing the use of copulae to model dynamical structures. Time variation in the first and second conditional moments is widely discussed in the literature, so allowing the time variation in the conditional dependence seems to be natural. This work presents some concepts and properties of copula functions and an application of the copula theory in the estimation of VaR of a portfolio composed by Nasdaq and S\&P500 stock indices.},

This paper deepens the understanding of this approach when used as credit rating predictor for companies. Unlike CreditMetrics™ that calculates a "Value at Risk due to Credit" KMV uses an equity value based approach to estimate a firm's credit risk. KMV provides a "rating" model rather than a "Value at Risk due to credit" model. The software is based on Merton's (197 4) option pricing approach. This approach is also known as the structural approach of pricing credit risk as it includes the asset-liability structure of a company. The motivation of this paper is to focus on the underlying assumptions of the models and to explain the resulting restrictions. This paper shows advantages and disadvantages of this credit risk measurement method.},

  author = {Nbucher, Philipp J Scho},
  abstract = {Much of the existing literature on default contagion assumes a direct causal relationships between two obligors’ defaults. In this paper we present a model in which default contagion arises without causal links solely from information effects if investors are imperfectly informed about some common factors affecting the true riskiness of the obligors. We model this effect in a simple extension of the intensity-based modelling framework using unobserved frailty variables. If one obligor defaults in this model, the default intensities of other obligors exhibit jumps which are proportional to the covariances of the corresponding frailties. This allows the modelling of much higher (and more realistic) levels of default dependence between the obligors than what purely diffusion-based intensity models were able to capture previously, without adding too much additional complexity. The parameters of the dependence can be implied directly from spread jumps observed in the market, thus enabling a full specification of the model under pricing probabilities without recourse to historical default correlations. We furthermore present an extension of the model in which the size of the contagion effect can depend on the reason for the default and not just the identity of the defaulted obligor, thus introducing stochastic dependency.},

  abstract = {Multivariate extreme value theory and methods concern the characterization, estimation and extrapolation of the joint tail of the distribution of a d-dimensional random variable. Existing approaches are based on limiting arguments in which all components of the variable become large at the same rate. This limit approach is inappropriate when the extreme values of all the variables are unlikely to occur together or when interest is in regions of the support of the joint distribution where only a subset of components is extreme. In practice this restricts existing methods to applications where d is typically 2 or 3. Under an assumption about the asymptotic form of the joint distribution of a d-dimensional random variable conditional on its having an extreme component, we develop an entirely new semiparametric approach which overcomes these existing restrictions and can be applied to problems of any dimension. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and its advantages over existing methods by using theoretical examples and simulation studies. The approach is used to analyse air pollution data and reveals complex extremal dependence behaviour that is consistent with scientific understanding of the process. We find that the dependence structure exhibits marked seasonality, with extremal dependence between some pollutants being significantly greater than the dependence at non-extreme levels.},

The optimized split-and-merge algorithm is shown to be adaptive to the image semantics and, hence, improves the segmentation validity of the previous algorithms.

  abstract = {This paper establishes unified frameworks of renewable weighted sums (RWS) for various online updating estimations in the models with streaming data sets. The newly defined RWS lays the foundation of online updating likelihood, online updating loss function, online updating estimating equation and so on. The idea of RWS is intuitive and heuristic, and the algorithm is computationally simple. This paper chooses nonparametric model as an exemplary setting. The RWS applies to various types of nonparametric estimators, which include but are not limited to nonparametric likelihood, quasilikelihood and least squares. Furthermore, the method and the theory can be extended into the models with both parameter and nonparametric function. The estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed renewable estimator are established, and the oracle property is obtained. Moreover, these properties are always satisfied, without any constraint on the number of data batches, which means that the new method is adaptive to the situation where streaming data sets arrive perpetually. The behavior of the method is further illustrated by various numerical examples from simulation experiments and real data analysis.},

  abstract = {Hydroclimatic time series analysis focuses on a few feature types (e.g., autocorrelations, trends, extremes), which describe a small portion of the entire information content of the observations. Aiming to exploit a larger part of the available information and, thus, to deliver more reliable results (e.g., in hydroclimatic time series clustering contexts), here we approach hydroclimatic time series analysis differently, i.e., by performing massive feature extraction. In this respect, we develop a big data framework for hydroclimatic variable behaviour characterization. This framework relies on approximately 60 diverse features and is completely automatic (in the sense that it does not depend on the hydroclimatic process at hand). We apply the new framework to characterize mean monthly temperature, total monthly precipitation and mean monthly river flow. The applications are conducted at the global scale by exploiting 40-year-long time series originating from over 13 000 stations. We extract interpretable knowledge on seasonality, trends, autocorrelation, long-range dependence and entropy, and on feature types that are met less frequently in the literature. We further compare the examined hydroclimatic variable types in terms of this knowledge and, identify patterns related to the spatial variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and exploit a hydroclimatic time series clustering methodology. This new methodology is based on Breiman’s random forests. The descriptive and exploratory insights gained by the globalscale applications prove the usefulness of the adopted feature compilation in hydroclimatic contexts. Moreover, the spatially coherent patterns characterizing the clusters delivered by the new methodology build confidence in its future exploitation. Given this spatial coherence and the scale-independent nature of the features (which makes them particularly useful in forecasting and simulation contexts), we believe that this methodology could also be beneficial within regionalization frameworks, in which knowledge on hydrological similarity is exploited in technical and operative terms.},

The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L1 penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm. Both simulated and real examples show that the method performs competitively.},

Specifically, it investigates why a simple average of forecasts often outperforms forecasts from single models in terms of MSFEs, and why a more complicated weighting scheme does not always perform better than a simple average. In addition, this paper presents two new findings that are particularly relevant in practice. First, the MSFE of a forecast combination decreases as the number of models increases. Second, the conventional approach to the selection of optimal models, based on a simple comparison of MSFEs without further statistical testing, leads to a biased selection.},

  abstract = {Forecast combinations have been widely applied in the last few decades to improve forecasting. Estimating optimal weights that can outperform simple averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of using time series features for forecast combinations has flourished. Although this idea has been proved to be beneficial in several forecasting competitions, it may not be practical in many situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate features to build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated based on the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the future. Other times, the estimation of the features is infeasible due to limited historical data. In this work, we suggest a change of focus from the historical data to the produced forecasts to extract features. We use out-of-sample forecasts to obtain weights for forecast combinations by amplifying the diversity of the pool of methods being combined. A rich set of time series is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our diversity-based forecast combination framework not only simplifies the modeling process but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency, elements that are important from both an optimization and a decision analysis perspective.},

Two masked subsets of the M3 monthly industry data, containing 111 and 11 empirical time series respectively, were chosen, controlling for multiple data conditions of time series length (short/long), data patterns (seasonal/non-seasonal) and forecasting horizons (short/medium/long). The relative forecasting accuracy was assessed using the metrics from the M3, together with later extensions of scaled measures, and non-parametric statistical tests. The NN3 competition attracted 59 submissions from NN, CI and statistics, making it the largest CI competition on time series data. Its main findings include: (a) only one NN outperformed the damped trend using the sMAPE, but more contenders outperformed the AutomatANN of the M3; (b) ensembles of CI approaches performed very well, better than combinations of statistical methods; (c) a novel, complex statistical method outperformed all statistical and CI benchmarks; and (d) for the most difficult subset of short and seasonal series, a methodology employing echo state neural networks outperformed all others. The NN3 results highlight the ability of NN to handle complex data, including short and seasonal time series, beyond prior expectations, and thus identify multiple avenues for future research.},

The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available.

In particular, we provide insights into the nature and mathematical derivation of the level-l conditional coherent (LlCC) point forecast reconciliation procedure for an elementary two-level hierarchy. We show that: (i) the LlCC procedure is the result of a linearly constrained minimization of a quadratic loss function, with an exogenous constraint given by the base forecast of the top level series of the hierarchy, which is not revised; and (ii) endogenous constraints may also be considered in the same framework, thereby resulting in level conditional reconciled forecasts where both the top and the bottom level time series forecasts are coherently revised. In addition, we show that the LlCC procedure (i.e., with exogenous constraints but the result also holds in the endogenous case) does not guarantee the non-negativity of the reconciled forecasts, which can be an issue in cases when non-negativity is a natural attribute of the variables that need to be forecast (e.g., sales and tourism flows). Finally, we consider two forecasting experiments to evaluate the performance of various cross-sectional forecast combination-based point forecast reconciliation procedures (vis-à-vis the state-of-the-art procedures) in a fair setting. In this framework, due to the crucial role played by the (possibly different) models used to compute the base forecasts, we re-interpret the combined conditional coherent reconciliation procedure (CCCH) of Hollyman et~al. (2021) as a forecast pooling approach, and show that accuracy improvements may be obtained by adopting a simple forecast averaging strategy.},

This paper proposes a nonparametric TVP-VAR model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The novelty of this model arises from the law of motion driving the parameters being treated nonparametrically. This leads to great flexibility in the nature and extent of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and in the conditional variance. In contrast to other nonparametric and machine learning methods that are black box, inference using our model is straightforward because, in treating the parameters rather than the variables nonparametrically, the model remains conditionally linear in the mean. Parsimony is achieved through adopting nonparametric factor structures and use of shrinkage priors. In an application to US macroeconomic data, we illustrate the use of our model in tracking both the evolving nature of the Phillips curve and how the effects of business cycle shocks on inflationary measures vary nonlinearly with movements in uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Assigning weights to a large pool of objects is a fundamental task in a wide variety of applications. In this article, we introduce the concept of structured high-dimensional probability simplexes, in which most components are zero or near zero and the remaining ones are close to each other. Such structure is well motivated by (i) high-dimensional weights that are common in modern applications, and (ii) ubiquitous examples in which equal weights---despite their simplicity---often achieve favorable or even state-of-the-art predictive performance. This particular structure, however, presents unique challenges partly because, unlike high-dimensional linear regression, the parameter space is a simplex and pattern switching between partial constancy and sparsity is unknown. To address these challenges, we propose a new class of double spike Dirichlet priors to shrink a probability simplex to one with the desired structure. When applied to ensemble learning, such priors lead to a Bayesian method for structured high-dimensional ensembles that is useful for forecast combination and improving random forests, while enabling uncertainty quantification. We design efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for implementation. Posterior contraction rates are established to study large sample behaviors of the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the wide applicability and competitive performance of the proposed methods through simulations and two real data applications using the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters data set and a data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI).},

  abstract = {Advances in information technology have led to extremely large datasets that are often kept in different storage centers. Existing statistical methods must be adapted to overcome the resulting computational obstacles while retaining statistical validity and efficiency. In this situation, the split-and-conquer strategy is among the most effective solutions to many statistical problems, including quantile processes, regression analysis, principal eigenspaces, and exponential families. This paper applies this strategy to develop a distributed learning procedure of finite Gaussian mixtures. We recommend a reduction strategy and invent an effective majorization-minimization algorithm. The new estimator is consistent and retains root-n consistency under some general conditions. Experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed estimator has comparable statistical performance with the global estimator based on the full dataset, if the latter is feasible. It can even outperform the global estimator for the purpose of clustering if the model assumption does not fully match the real-world data. It also has better statistical and computational performance than some existing split-and-conquer approaches.},

  abstract = {Varying coefficient models (VCMs) are widely used for estimating nonlinear regression functions for functional data. Their Bayesian variants using Gaussian process priors on the functional coefficients, however, have received limited attention in massive data applications, mainly due to the prohibitively slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We address this problem using a divide-and-conquer Bayesian approach. We first create a large number of data subsamples with much smaller sizes. Then, we formulate the VCM as a linear mixed-effects model and develop a data augmentation algorithm for obtaining MCMC draws on all the subsets in parallel. Finally, we aggregate the MCMC-based estimates of subset posteriors into a single Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC) posterior, which is used as a computationally efficient alternative to the true posterior distribution. Theoretically, we derive minimax optimal posterior convergence rates for the AMC posteriors of both the varying coefficients and the mean regression function. We provide quantification on the orders of subset sample sizes and the number of subsets. The empirical results show that the combination schemes that satisfy our theoretical assumptions, including the AMC posterior, have better estimation performance than their main competitors across diverse simulations and in a real data analysis.},

We propose a general construction of a functional mapping from the covariate space to the cone of sparse positive definite matrices, which encompasses many existing graphical models for heterogeneous settings. Our methodology is based on a novel mixture prior for precision matrices with a non-local component that admits attractive theoretical and empirical properties. The flexible formulation of GGMx allows both the strength and the sparsity pattern of the precision matrix (hence the graph structure) change with the covariates. Posterior inference is carried out with a carefully designed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which ensures the positive definiteness of sparse precision matrices at any given covariates' values. Extensive simulations and a case study in cancer genomics demonstrate the utility of the proposed model.},

Our method is based on a Bayesian dynamic model that can adapt to conditional distribution changes and a deep conditional distribution model that can handle large multivariate time series using a factorized output space. Our experimental results on synthetic and popular public datasets show that our model can adapt to non-stationary time series better than state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.},

  abstract = {The electricity industry is heavily implementing smart grid technologies to improve reliability, availability, security, and efficiency. This implementation needs technological advancements, the development of standards and regulations, as well as testing and planning. Smart grid load forecasting and management are critical for reducing demand volatility and improving the market mechanism that connects generators, distributors, and retailers. During policy implementations or external interventions, it is necessary to analyse the uncertainty of their impact on the electricity demand to enable a more accurate response of the system to fluctuating demand. This paper analyses the uncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting models using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact distribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on energy usage as a case study to evaluate the non-uniform effect of this intervention on the electricity demand distribution. We could show that during the initial lockdowns in Australia and some European countries, there was often a more significant decrease in the troughs than in the peaks, while the mean remained almost unaffected.},

  abstract = {Self-exciting Hawkes processes are used to model events which cluster in time and space, and have been widely studied in seismology under the name of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. In the ETAS framework, the occurrence of the mainshock earthquakes in a geographical region is assumed to follow an inhomogeneous spatial point process, and aftershock events are then modelled via a separate triggering kernel. Most previous studies of the ETAS model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters due to the complexity of the likelihood function, and the difficulty in estimating an appropriate mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the spatial mainshock process. Direct inference for the resulting model is problematic due to the strong correlation of the parameters for the mainshock and triggering processes, so we instead use an auxiliary latent variable routine to perform efficient inference.},

We delineate the four common themes of neuroimaging data and review major image processing analysis methods for processing neuroimaging data at the individual level. We briefly review four large-scale neuroimaging-related studies and a consortium on imaging genomics and discuss four common themes of neuroimaging data analysis at the population level. We review nine major population-based statistical analysis methods and their associated statistical challenges and present recent progress in statistical methodology to address these challenges.},

The different approaches nested within this framework include methods that exploit information at all levels of the hierarchy as well as a novel method based on cross-validation. The methods are evaluated using real data from two wind farms in Crete and electric load in Boston. For these applications, optimal decisions related to grid operations and bidding strategies are based on coherent probabilistic forecasts of energy power. Empirical evidence is also presented showing that probabilistic forecast reconciliation improves the accuracy of the probabilistic forecasts.},

A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to make probabilistic projections of the 39,800 bilateral migration flows among the 200 most populous countries. We generate out-of-sample forecasts for all bilateral flows for the 2015 to 2020 period, using models fitted to bilateral migration flows for five 5-y periods from 1990 to 1995 through 2010 to 2015. We find that the model produces well-calibrated out-of-sample forecasts of bilateral flows, as well as total country-level inflows, outflows, and net flows. The mean absolute error decreased by 61\% using our method, compared to a leading model of international migration. Out-of-sample analysis indicated that simple methods for forecasting migration flows offered accurate projections of bilateral migration flows in the near term. Our method matched or improved on the out-of-sample performance using these simple deterministic alternatives, while also accurately assessing uncertainty. We integrate the migration flow forecasting model into a fully probabilistic population projection model to generate bilateral migration flow forecasts by age and sex for all flows from 2020 to 2025 through 2040 to 2045.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is crucial for many fields, such as disaster warning, weather prediction, and energy consumption. The Transformer-based models are considered to have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling. However, the complex temporal patterns of the time series hinder the model from mining reliable temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the autoregressive form of the Transformer introduces cumulative errors in the inference step. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic decomposition Transformer model that combines the Transformer with a conditional generative model, which provides hierarchical and interpretable probabilistic forecasts for intricate time series. The Transformer is employed to learn temporal patterns and implement primary probabilistic forecasts, while the conditional generative model is used to achieve non-autoregressive hierarchical probabilistic forecasts by introducing latent space feature representations. In addition, the conditional generative model reconstructs typical features of the series, such as seasonality and trend terms, from probability distributions in the latent space to enable complex pattern separation and provide interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model, indicating that it compares favorably with the state of the art.},

We first group time series at each aggregated level, while simultaneously leveraging local and global information. The proposed method can cluster hierarchical time series (HTS) with different lengths and structures. For common two-level hierarchies, we employ a combined objective for local and global clustering over spaces of discrete probability measures, using Wasserstein distance coupled with Soft-DTW divergence. For multi-level hierarchies, we present a bottom-up procedure that progressively leverages lower-level information for higher-level clustering. Our final goal is to improve both the accuracy and speed of forecasts for a larger number of HTS needed for a real-world application. To attain this goal, each time series is first assigned the forecast for its cluster representative, which can be considered as a "shrinkage prior" for the set of time series it represents. Then this base forecast can be quickly fine-tuned to adjust to the specifics of that time series. We empirically show that our method substantially improves performance in terms of both speed and accuracy for large-scale forecasting tasks involving much HTS.},

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities.

This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics.

To fix the problem, a novel one-step estimation method is developed with the following nice properties. First, the algorithm is communication efficient. That is the communication cost demanded is practically acceptable. Second, the resulting estimator is statistically efficient. That is its asymptotic covariance is the same as that of the global estimator. Third, the estimator is robust against data distribution. That is its consistency is guaranteed even if data are not randomly distributed across different workers. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our findings.

Recently, the use of time series features for forecast model averaging has been an emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to extract features from time series automatically becomes crucial in state-of-the-art time series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on time series imaging. We first transform time series into recurrence plots, from which local features can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted features are used for forecast model averaging. Our experiments show that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less human intervention and a more comprehensive view of the raw time series data, yields highly comparable performances with the best methods in the largest forecasting competition dataset (M4) and outperforms the top methods in the Tourism forecasting competition dataset.},

By approximating the local objective function using a local quadratic form, we are able to obtain a combined estimator by taking a weighted average of local estimators. The resulting estimator is proved to be statistically as efficient as the global estimator. Moreover, it requires only one round of communication. We further conduct a shrinkage estimation based on the DLSA estimation using an adaptive Lasso approach. The solution can be easily obtained by using the LARS algorithm on the master node. It is theoretically shown that the resulting estimator possesses the oracle property and is selection consistent by using a newly designed distributed Bayesian information criterion. The finite sample performance and computational efficiency are further illustrated by an extensive numerical study and an airline dataset. The airline dataset is 52 GB in size. The entire methodology has been implemented in Python for a de-facto standard Spark system. The proposed DLSA algorithm on the Spark system takes 26 min to obtain a logistic regression estimator, which is more efficient and memory friendly than conventional methods.

We find that the impacts of the money supply and the short-term interest rates are positive, whereas the impacts of exchange rates are negative. The roles of the CPI on credit risk clustering are ambiguous. Idiosyncratic factors are vital for predicting credit risk clustering.

However, changes or inflections in temporal trends within subgroups and states are not fully documented. We assessed temporal patterns and inflections in the rates of firearm deaths and \%YPLL due to firearms for overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, intent, and states in the United States between 1999 and 2016. Methods We extracted age-adjusted firearm mortality and YPLL rates per 100,000, and \%YPLL from 1999 to 2016 by using the WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. We used Joinpoint Regression to assess temporal trends, the inflection points, and annual percentage change (APC) from 1999 to 2016. Results National firearm mortality rates were 10.3 and 11.8 per 100,000 in 1999 and 2016, with two distinct segments; a plateau until 2014 followed by an increase of APC = 7.2\% (95\% CI 3.1, 11.4). YPLL rates were from 304.7 and 338.2 in 1999 and 2016 with a steady APC increase in \%YPLL of 0.65\% (95\% CI 0.43, 0.87) from 1999 to an inflection point in 2014, followed by a larger APC in \%YPLL of 5.1\% (95\% CI 0.1, 10.4). The upward trend in firearm mortality and YPLL rates starting in 2014 was observed in subgroups of male, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanic whites and for firearm assaults. The inflection points for firearm mortality and YPLL rates also varied across states. Conclusions Within the United States, firearm mortality rates and YPLL remained constant between 1999 and 2014 and has been increasing subsequently. There was, however, an increase in firearm mortality rates in several subgroups and individual states earlier than 2014.},

MULTITUDE is an individual-level pooled database of demographics, comorbidities, relevant medications, clinical laboratory values, cardiac health measures, and T2DM-associated events and outcomes across 45 US states and the District of Columbia. Findings to date Among the 135 156 ongoing participants included in the consortium, almost 25\% (33 421) were diagnosed with T2DM at baseline. The average age of the participants was 54.3, while the average age of participants with diabetes was 64.2. Men (55.3\%) and women (44.6\%) were almost equally represented across the consortium. Non-whites accounted for 31.6\% of the total participants and 40\% of those diagnosed with T2DM. Fewer individuals with diabetes reported being regular smokers than their non-diabetic counterparts (40.3\% vs 47.4\%). Over 85\% of those with diabetes were reported as either overweight or obese at baseline, compared with 60.7\% of those without T2DM. We observed differences in all-cause mortality, overall and by T2DM status, between cohorts. Future plans Given the wide variation in demographics and all-cause mortality in the cohorts, MULTITUDE consortium will be a unique resource for conducting research to determine: differences in the incidence and progression of T2DM; sequence of events or biomarkers prior to T2DM diagnosis; disease progression from T2DM to disease-related outcomes, complications and premature mortality; and to assess race/ethnicity differences in the above associations.},

  abstract = {Copulas provide an attractive approach to the construction of multivariate distributions with flexible marginal distributions and different forms of dependences. Of particular importance in many areas is the possibility of forecasting the tail-dependences explicitly. Most of the available approaches are only able to estimate tail-dependences and correlations via nuisance parameters, and cannot be used for either interpretation or forecasting. We propose a general Bayesian approach for modeling and forecasting tail-dependences and correlations as explicit functions of covariates, with the aim of improving the copula forecasting performance. The proposed covariate-dependent copula model also allows for Bayesian variable selection from among the covariates of the marginal models, as well as the copula density. The copulas that we study include the Joe-Clayton copula, the Clayton copula, the Gumbel copula and the Student’s t-copula. Posterior inference is carried out using an efficient MCMC simulation method. Our approach is applied to both simulated data and the S\&P 100 and S\&P 600 stock indices. The forecasting performance of the proposed approach is compared with those of other modeling strategies based on log predictive scores. A value-at-risk evaluation is also performed for the model comparisons.},

  abstract = {This thesis develops models and associated Bayesian inference methods for flexible univariate and multivariate conditional density estimation. The models are flexible in the sense that they can capture widely differing shapes of the data. The estimation methods are specifically designed to achieve flexibility while still avoiding overfitting. The models are flexible both for a given covariate value, but also across covariate space. A key contribution of this thesis is that it provides general approaches of density estimation with highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The methods are illustrated on several challenging non-linear and non-normal datasets. In the first paper, a general model is proposed for flexibly estimating the density of a continuous response variable conditional on a possibly high-dimensional set of covariates. The model is a finite mixture of asymmetric student-t densities with covariate-dependent mixture weights. The four parameters of the components, the mean, degrees of freedom, scale and skewness, are all modeled as functions of the covariates. The second paper explores how well a smooth mixture of symmetric components can capture skewed data. Simulations and applications on real data show that including covariate-dependent skewness in the components can lead to substantially improved performance on skewed data, often using a much smaller number of components. We also introduce smooth mixtures of gamma and log-normal components to model positively-valued response variables. In the third paper we propose a multivariate Gaussian surface regression model that combines both additive splines and interactive splines, and a highly efficient MCMC algorithm that updates all the multi-dimensional knot locations jointly. We use shrinkage priors to avoid overfitting with different estimated shrinkage factors for the additive and surface part of the model, and also different shrinkage parameters for the different response variables. In the last paper we present a general Bayesian approach for directly modeling dependencies between variables as function of explanatory variables in a flexible copula context. In particular, the Joe-Clayton copula is extended to have covariate-dependent tail dependence and correlations. Posterior inference is carried out using a novel and efficient simulation method. The appendix of the thesis documents the computational implementation details.},

We evaluate our approach using a large set of time series from the M4 competition.

We model the forecast error as a function of time series features calculated from historical time series with an efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach. The minimum predicted forecast error is then used to identify an individual model or a combination of models to produce the final forecasts. It is well known that the performance of most meta-learning models depends on the representativeness of the reference dataset used for training. In such circumstances, we augment the reference dataset with a feature-based time series simulation approach, namely GRATIS, to generate a rich and representative time series collection. The proposed framework is tested using the M4 competition data and is compared against commonly used forecasting approaches. Our approach provides comparable performance to other model selection and combination approaches but at a lower computational cost and a higher degree of interpretability, which is important for supporting decisions. We also provide useful insights regarding which forecasting models are expected to work better for particular types of time series, the intrinsic mechanisms of the meta-learners, and how the forecasting performance is affected by various factors.},

Graphics processing units can alleviate the processor bottleneck, but memory or disk bottlenecks can only be eliminated by splitting data across multiple machines. Communication between large numbers of machines is expensive (regardless of the amount of data being communicated), so there is a need for algorithms that perform distributed approximate Bayesian analyses with minimal communication. Consensus Monte Carlo operates by running a separate Monte Carlo algorithm on each machine, and then averaging individual Monte Carlo draws across machines. Depending on the model, the resulting draws can be nearly indistinguishable from the draws that would have been obtained by running a single-machine algorithm for a very long time. Examples of consensus Monte Carlo are shown for simple models where single-machine solutions are available, for large single-layer hierarchical models, and for Bayesian additive regression trees (BART).},

  abstract = {Distributed data naturally arise in scenarios involving multiple sources of observations, each stored at a different location. Directly pooling all the data together is often prohibited due to limited bandwidth and storage, or due to privacy protocols. A new robust distributed algorithm is introduced for fitting linear regressions when data are subject to heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric errors with finite second moments. The algorithm only communicates gradient information at each iteration, and therefore is communication-efficient. To achieve the bias-robustness tradeoff, the key is a novel double-robustification approach that applies on both the local and global objective functions. Statistically, the resulting estimator achieves the centralized nonasymptotic error bound as if all the data were pooled together and came from a distribution with sub-Gaussian tails. Under a finite (2+δ)-th moment condition, a Berry-Esseen bound for the distributed estimator is established, based on which robust confidence intervals are constructed. In high dimensions, the proposed doubly-robustified loss function is complemented with ℓ1-penalization for fitting sparse linear models with distributed data. Numerical studies further confirm that compared with extant distributed methods, the proposed methods achieve near-optimal accuracy with low variability and better coverage with tighter confidence width.},

  abstract = {Divide-and-conquer Bayesian methods consist of three steps: dividing the data into smaller computationally manageable subsets, running a sampling algorithm in parallel on all the subsets, and combining parameter draws from all the subsets. The combined parameter draws are used for efficient posterior inference in massive data settings. A major restriction of existing divide-and-conquer methods is that their first two steps assume that the observations are independent. We address this problem by developing a divide-and-conquer method for Bayesian inference in parametric hidden Markov models, where the state space is known and finite. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, after partitioning the data into smaller blocks of consecutive observations, we modify the likelihood for performing posterior computations on the subsets such that the posterior variances of the subset and true posterior distributions have the same asymptotic order. Second, if the number of subsets is chosen appropriately depending on the mixing properties of the hidden Markov chain, then we show that the subset posterior distributions defined using the modified likelihood are asymptotically normal as the subset sample size tends to infinity. The latter result also implies that we can use any existing combination algorithm in the third step. We show that the combined posterior distribution obtained using one such algorithm is close to the true posterior distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance under widely used regularity assumptions. Our numerical results show that the proposed method provides an accurate approximation of the true posterior distribution than its competitors in diverse simulation studies and a real data analysis.},

  abstract = {Today, a myriad data sources, from the Internet to business operations to scientific instruments, produce large and valuable data streams. However, the processing capabilities of single machines have not kept up with the size of data. As a result, organizations increasingly need to scale out these computations to clusters of hundreds of machines. At the same time, the speed and sophistication required of data processing have grown. In addition to simple queries, complex algorithms like machine learning and graph analysis are becoming common. And in addition to batch processing, streaming analysis of real-time data is required to let organizations take timely action. Future computing platforms will need to not only scale out traditional workloads, but support these new applications too. This book, a revised version of the 2014 ACM Dissertation Award winning dissertation, proposes an architecture for cluster computing systems that can tackle emerging data processing workloads at scale. Whereas early cluster computing systems, like MapReduce, handled batch processing, our architecture also enables streaming and interactive queries, while keeping MapReduce's scalability and fault tolerance. And whereas most deployed systems only support simple one-pass computations (e.g., SQL queries), ours also extends to the multi-pass algorithms required for complex analytics like machine learning. Finally, unlike the specialized systems proposed for some of these workloads, our architecture allows these computations to be combined, enabling rich new applications that intermix, for example, streaming and batch processing. We achieve these results through a simple extension to MapReduce that adds primitives for data sharing, called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). We show that this is enough to capture a wide range of workloads. We implement RDDs in the open source Spark system, which we evaluate using synthetic and real workloads. Spark matches or exceeds the performance of specialized systems in many domains, while offering stronger fault tolerance properties and allowing these workloads to be combined. Finally, we examine the generality of RDDs from both a theoretical modeling perspective and a systems perspective. This version of the dissertation makes corrections throughout the text and adds a new section on the evolution of Apache Spark in industry since 2014. In addition, editing, formatting, drawing of illustrations, and links for the references have been added.},

Most previous studies of the ETAS model have relied on point estimates of the model parameters, due to the complexity of the likelihood function and the difficulty in estimating an appropriate spatial mainshock distribution. In order to take estimation uncertainty into account, we instead propose a fully Bayesian formulation of the ETAS model, which uses a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture prior to capture the spatial mainshock process, and show how efficient parameter inference can be carried out using auxiliary latent variables. We demonstrate how our model can be used for medium-term earthquake forecasts in a number of geographical regions.},

In this work, we develop a subsampling approach for feature screening with massive datasets. The approach is implemented by repeated subsampling of massive data and can be used for analyzing tasks with memory constraints. To conduct the procedure, we first calculate an R-squared screening measure (and related sample moments) based on subsamples. Second, we consider three methods to combine the local statistics. In addition to the simple average method, we design a jackknife debiased screening measure and an aggregated moment screening measure. Both approaches reduce the bias of the subsampling screening measure and therefore increase the accuracy of the feature screening. Last, we consider a novel sequential sampling method, that is more computationally efficient than the traditional random sampling method. The theoretical properties of the three screening measures under both sampling schemes are rigorously discussed. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method with an airline dataset containing 32.7 million records.},

This approach features a division of the large scale data set into smaller ones with manageable sizes, based on their physical locations, and fit a local model in each area. The local model estimates are then combined sequentially from the specified multilevel models using our novel bottom-up approach for parameter estimation. The prediction, on the other hand, is implemented in a top-down matter. The proposed method is applied to the solar energy prediction problem for the U.S. Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative.},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$}0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01–0.07 σ) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1–0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur.},

However, numerous modern forecasting methods are still designed to create deterministic forecasts. Transforming these deterministic forecasts into probabilistic forecasts is often challenging and based on numerous assumptions that may not hold in real-world situations. Therefore, the present article proposes a novel approach for creating probabilistic forecasts from arbitrary deterministic forecasts. In order to implement this approach, we use a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). More specifically, we apply a cINN to learn the underlying distribution of the data and then combine the uncertainty from this distribution with an arbitrary deterministic forecast to generate accurate probabilistic forecasts. Our approach enables the simple creation of probabilistic forecasts without complicated statistical loss functions or further assumptions. Besides showing the mathematical validity of our approach, we empirically show that our approach noticeably outperforms traditional methods for including uncertainty in deterministic forecasts and generally outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Current intermittent demand inventory control models assume that the demand interval is memoryless: the probability of observing a positive demand does not depend on the time since the last demand occurred. Contrarily, several forecasting contributions suggest that demand intervals contain more distributional information. We find that the data of the M5 forecasting competition confirms this. Therefore, we propose an inventory control model that explicitly uses the full distributions of the demand sizes and intervals and thereby acknowledges that the probability of a demand occurrence may vary throughout the interval. To exploit this information, we also allow for time-varying order-up-to levels that flexibly adjust inventories according to the dynamic requirements. We derive the long-run average holding costs, non-stockout probability, order fill rate, and volume fill rate. Inspired by an analogy with multi-item inventory control models, we propose a greedy marginal-analysis heuristic to optimize the order-up-to levels, which we benchmark against the optimal solution on theoretical instances. In a simulation study on the M5 competition data we demonstrate this method’s improved on-target service performance compared to that of traditional solutions. We furthermore show that target service levels can be achieved at significantly lower costs with time-varying than with fixed order-up-to levels.},

Aggregated forecasting supports strategic decisions on location. Product-level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions at the store level. The factors that influence demand, and in particular promotional information, add considerable complexity, so that forecasters potentially face the dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to evaluate evidence on comparative forecasting accuracy. Although causal models outperform simple benchmarks, adequate evidence on machine learning methods has not yet accumulated. Methods for forecasting new products are examined separately, with little evidence being found on the effectiveness of the various approaches. The paper concludes by describing company forecasting practices, offering conclusions as to both research gaps and barriers to improved practice.},

It becomes even more challenging if the spare parts demand distribution is highly complex due to strong interdependent demand intermittency and extremely irregular demand. The research literature proposes many analytical methods for forecasting spare parts demand. But, due to their limited flexibility in modeling complex demand patterns, existing forecasting methods may not produce satisfactory results for a spare parts portfolio displaying extremely complex demand patterns. This study proposes a novel nonparametric Bayesian forecasting approach with its roots in the empirical Bayes paradigm. The method is subject to few performance constraints and is highly flexible in dealing with a rich diversity of demand patterns, including extreme demand complexity. We assess the relative performance of this new approach with several prominent methods in the literature using an automotive parts distributor's empirical demand data for 46,272 stock-keeping units. This dataset is representative of typical spare parts portfolios that are characterized by a wide variety and extremely complex demand patterns. The experimental findings show the new Bayesian approach achieves the best overall performance in terms of inventory efficiency and minimal backorders for meeting specified target service levels. This favorable performance reflects the approach's flexibility to accommodate disparate and complex demand patterns, including interdependence of demand intermittency, irregular demand distribution, and even nonstationary demand distribution to some extent, and provide robust solutions.},

  abstract = {We are concerned with the interaction and integration between demand forecasting and inventory control, in the context of supply chain operations. The majority of the literature is fragmented. Forecasting research more often than not assumes forecasting to be an end in itself, disregarding any subsequent stages of computation that are needed to transform forecasts into replenishment decisions. Conversely, most contributions in inventory theory assume that demand (and its parameters) are known, in effect disregarding any preceding stages of computation. Explicit recognition of these shortcomings is an important step towards more realistic theoretical developments, but still not particularly helpful unless they are somehow addressed. Even then, forecasts often constitute exogenous variables that serially feed into a stock control model. Finally, there is a small but growing stream of research that is explicitly built around jointly tackling the inventory forecasting question. We introduce a framework to define four levels of integration: from disregarding, to acknowledging, to partly addressing, to fully understanding the interactions. Focusing on the last two, we conduct a structured review of relevant (integrated) academic contributions in the area of forecasting and inventory control and argue for their classification with regard to integration. We show that the development from one level to another is in many cases chronological in order, but also associated with specific schools of thought. We also argue that although movement from one level to another adds realism, it also adds complexity in terms of actual implementations, and thus a trade-off exists. The article makes a contribution into an area that has always been fragmented despite the importance of bringing the forecasting and inventory communities together to solve problems of common interest. We close with an indicative agenda for further research and a call for more theoretical contributions, but also more work that would help to expand the empirical knowledge base in this area.},

The installed base is defined as the set of products (or machines) in use where the part is installed. Information on the number of products still in use, the age of the products, the age of their parts, as well as the part reliability may indicate when a part will fail and trigger a demand for a new spare part. The current literature is unclear which of this installed base information adds most value – and should thus be collected – for inventory control purposes. For this reason, we evaluate the inventory performance of eight methods that include different sets of installed base information in their demand forecasts. Using a comparative simulation study we identify that knowing the size of the active installed base is most valuable, especially when the installed base changes over time. We also find that when a failure-based prediction model is used, it is important to work with the part age itself, rather than the machine age. When one is not able to collect information on the part age, a logistic regression on the machine age might be a valuable alternative to a failure-based prediction model. Our findings may support the prioritization of data collection for spare part demand forecasting and inventory control.},

People constantly try to get better, in practically all aspects of their personal and professional life, and thus OR is de facto a ubiquitous science. What might however not be that clear, is that the way we improve is driven by the very OR science, and the scientific results that constitute the respective body of literature, theory and practice. Of all the tasks, that can be related to the OR science, the one that more frequently we do, is forecasting. We do constantly try to estimate what is coming next, and we drive our decisions for each and every situation based on these forecasts: from where to put our money to who will be the best surgeon to operate us. Within the broad boundaries of OR, forecasting stands out as the most ubiquitous sub-discipline. In the forecasting literature, a lot of attention has been given to modeling fast-moving time series and building causal models; however, very limited attention has been given to intermittent time series and intermittent demand forecasting. In this research, we advocate for the broader use of intermittent demand forecasting methods for forecasting special events, as a simpler, faster, and robust alternative to more complex non-OR models. Furthermore, in a foresight context, we argue for a novel way of deciding the strategic planning horizon for phenomena prone to appearance of special events.},

  abstract = {Spare parts are often associated with intermittent demand patterns that render their forecasting a challenging task. Forecasting of spare parts demand has been researched through both parametric and non-parametric approaches. However, little has been contributed in this area from a Bayesian perspective, and most of such research is built around the Poisson demand distributional assumption. However, the Poisson distribution is known to have certain limitations and, further, empirical evidence on the inventory performance of Bayesian methods is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian method based on compound Poisson distributions. The proposed method is compared to the Poisson-based Bayesian method with a Gamma prior distribution as well as to a parametric frequentist method and to a non-parametric one. A numerical investigation (on 7400 theoretically generated series) is complemented by an empirical assessment on demand data from about 3000 stock keeping units in the automotive sector to analyse the performance of the four forecasting methods. We find that both Bayesian methods outperform the other methods with a higher inventory efficiency reported for the Poisson Bayesian method with a Gamma prior. This outperformance increases for higher demand variability. From a practical perspective, the outperformance of the proposed method is associated with some added complexity. We also find that the performance of the non-parametric method improves for longer lead-times and higher demand variability when compared to the parametric one.},

However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent, but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate for producing forecasts with such features. We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.},

The forecasting literature, often disjoint from the needs of the forecast users, has focused on providing optimal models in terms of likelihood and various accuracy metrics. However, there is evidence that this does not always lead to better inventory performance, as often the translation between forecast errors and inventory results is not linear. In this study, we consider an approach to parametrising forecasting models by directly considering appropriate inventory metrics and the current inventory policy. We propose a way to combine the competing multiple inventory objectives, i.e. meeting demand, while eliminating excessive stock, and use the resulting cost function to identify inventory optimal parameters for forecasting models. We evaluate the proposed parametrisation against established alternatives and demonstrate its performance on real data. Furthermore, we explore the connection between forecast accuracy and inventory performance and discuss the extent to which the former is an appropriate proxy of the latter.},

Sequential Bayesian analysis involves fast, parallel filtering on sets of decoupled items, and is adaptable across items that may exhibit widely-varying characteristics. A multi-scale approach enables information to be shared across items with related patterns over time in order to improve prediction, while maintaining the scalability to many items. A motivating case study in many-item, multi-period, multi-step-ahead supermarket sales forecasting provides examples that demonstrate an improved forecast accuracy on multiple metrics, and illustrates the benefits of full probabilistic models for forecast accuracy evaluation and comparison.},

  abstract = {Participants in electricity markets face a substantial amount of uncertainty, and with Increased penetration of volatile renewable generation this uncertainty has further increased. Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market. Recently, an alternative so-called stochastic settlement market has been proposed (see, e.g., Pritchard et al. 2010 [Pritchard G, Zakeri G, Philpott A (2010) A single-settlement, energy-only electric power market for unpredictable and intermittent participants. Oper. Res. 58(4):1210-1219.] and Bouffard et al. 2005 [Bouffard F, Galiana FD, Conejo AJ (2005) Market-clearing with stochastic security-Part I: Formulation. IEEE Trans. Power Systems 20(4):1818-1826.]) where the ISO clears both stages in one single settlement market.\& para;\& para;While the effectiveness of the stochastic market clearing mechanism is clear when the market is competitive, this is open to question for imperfectly competitive markets. In this paper we consider simplified models for two types of market clearing mechanisms. First, a market clearing mechanism utilized in New Zealand, whereby firms offer in advance and are notified of a clearing quantity and price guide based on an estimate of demand, followed by real-time dispatch. We refer to this as NZTS. Secondly we consider a simplified stochastic programming market clearing mechanism. We compute Nash equilibria of games resulting from each of the market clearing mechanisms. We prove that under the assumption of symmetry, our simplified stochastic programming market clearing is equivalent to a two-period single settlement system that takes account of deviation penalties in the second stage. These, however, differ from NZTS. We show that when we assume symmetry, this stochastic settlement model results in better social welfare than does NZTS. We also investigate a number of asymmetric examples numerically.},

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy. We also find that curtailing intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions.},

Many influential contributions have been made in this area, reflecting different perspectives that have evolved in divergent strands of the literature, namely: system dynamics, control theory and forecasting theory (both statistical and judgemental). Although this pluralism is healthy in terms of knowledge advancement, it also signifies the fragmentation of the OR discipline and the lack of cross-fertilization of ideas to develop more comprehensive approaches towards the resolution of the same issues. In this paper, the relevant literature is reviewed and synthesized to promote some convergence between these different approaches to inventory forecasting and planning. The review concludes with an inter-disciplinary agenda for further research.},

Despite these advances, even today we are unable to answer a very simple question, the one that is always the first tabled during discussions with practitioners: “what is the best method for my data?”. In essence, as there are horses for courses, there must also be forecasting methods that are more tailored to some types of data, and, therefore, enable practitioners to make informed method selection when facing new data. The current study attempts to shed light on this direction via identifying the main determinants of forecasting accuracy, through simulations and empirical investigations involving 14 popular forecasting methods (and combinations of them), seven time series features (seasonality, trend, cycle, randomness, number of observations, inter-demand interval and coefficient of variation) and one strategic decision (the forecasting horizon). Our main findings dictate that forecasting accuracy is influenced as follows: (a) for fast-moving data, cycle and randomness have the biggest (negative) effect and the longer the forecasting horizon, the more accuracy decreases; (b) for intermittent data, inter-demand interval has bigger (negative) impact than the coefficient of variation; and (c) for all types of data, increasing the length of a series has a small positive effect.},

  abstract = {Buildings are one of the major sources of electricity and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) in urban areas all around the world. Since a large integration of solar energy is observed in the form of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) units, electricity use of buildings is highly uncertain due to intermittent nature of solar output power. This leads to poor energy management for both network operators and building owners. In addition, uncertain metrological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings are big hurdles to accurate prediction of the demand. To improve accuracy of load demand forecast of PV integrated smart building, a hybrid ensemble framework is proposed in this paper. This is based on a combination of five different predictors named as backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (EN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), feed forward neural network (FNN), radial basis function (RBF) and their wavelet transform (WT) models. WT is applied to historical load data to remove the spikes and fluctuations. FNN and RBF network were trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for higher forecast accuracy. The output of each predictor in the ensemble network is combined using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The proposed framework is tested using real data of two practical PV integrated smart buildings in a big university environment. The results indicate that the proposed framework show improvement in average forecast normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) around 17\% and 20\% in seasonal daily and seasonal weekly case studies, respectively. In addition, proposed framework also produces lowest of nRMSE about 3.88\% in seasonal monthly forecast of smart buildings with rooftop PV as compared to benchmark model. The proposed forecast framework provides consistent forecast results for global change institute (GCI) and advance engineering building (AEB) during seasonal daily and weekly comparison.},

Polynomial splines are used to model the main effects, and their tensor products are used to model any interaction components that are included. In the special context of survival analysis, the baseline hazard function is modeled and nonproportionality is allowed. In general, the theory involves the \$L\_2\$ rate of convergence for the fitted model and its components. The methodology involves least squares and maximum likelihood estimation, stepwise addition of basis functions using Rao statistics, stepwise deletion using Wald statistics and model selection using the Bayesian information criterion, cross-validation or an independent test set. Publicly available software, written in C and interfaced to S/S-PLUS, is used to apply this methodology to real data.},

Yet, prediction algorithms can be constructed that work well for all possible sequences, in the sense that their performance is always nearly as good as the best forecasting strategy in a given reference class. The central theme is the model of prediction using expert advice, a general framework within which many related problems can be cast and discussed. Repeated game playing, adaptive data compression, sequential investment in the stock market, sequential pattern analysis, and several other problems are viewed as instances of the experts' framework and analyzed from a common nonstochastic standpoint that often reveals new and intriguing connections.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java.

The method uses reversible‐jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to change the knot configurations and a locality heuristic to speed up mixing. For nonnormal models, we approximate the integrated likelihood ratios needed to compute acceptance probabilities by using the Bayesian information criterion, BIC, under priors that make this approximation accurate. Our technique is based on a marginalised chain on the knot number and locations, but we provide methods for inference about the regression coefficients, and functions of them, in both normal and nonnormal models. Simulation results suggest that the method performs well, and we illustrate the method in two neuroscience applications.},

Sequential Monte Carlo with approximate Bayesian computations (SMC-ABC) is one approach to approximate the likelihood in this type of models. However, such approximations can be noisy and computationally costly which hinders efficient implementations using standard methods based on optimisation and Monte Carlo methods. We propose a computationally efficient novel method based on the combination of Gaussian process optimisation and SMC-ABC to create a Laplace approximation of the intractable posterior. We exemplify the proposed algorithm for inference in stochastic volatility models with both synthetic and real-world data as well as for estimating the Value-at-Risk for two portfolios using a copula model. We document speed-ups of between one and two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for posterior inference.},

We explore this relationship by applying simulated annealing to an SG-MCMC algorithm. Furthermore, we extend recent SG-MCMC methods with two key components: i) adaptive preconditioners (as in ADAgrad or RMSprop), and ii) adaptive element-wise momentum weights. The zero-temperature limit gives a novel stochastic optimization method with adaptive element-wise momentum weights, while conventional optimization methods only have a shared, static momentum weight. Under certain assumptions, our theoretical analysis suggests the proposed simulated annealing approach converges close to the global optima. Experiments on several deep neural network models show state-of-the-art results compared to related stochastic optimization algorithms.},

Although the majority of studies have reported increases in accuracy, many exhibit design weaknesses, including a lack of adequate benchmarks or rigorous evaluation. Furthermore, their usefulness over the product life-cycle has not been investigated, even though this may change, as consumers may search initially for pre-purchase information, but later for after-sales support. This study begins by reviewing the relevant literature, then attempts to support the key findings using two forecasting case studies. Our findings are in stark contrast to those in the previous literature, as we find that established univariate forecasting benchmarks, such as exponential smoothing, consistently perform better those that include online information. Our research underlines the need for a thorough forecast evaluation and argues that the usefulness of online platform data for supporting operational decisions may be limited.},

Seven well-established methods have been shown to improve accuracy: combining forecasts and Delphi help for all types of data; causal modeling, judgmental bootstrapping and structured judgment help with cross-sectional data; and causal models and trend-damping help with time series data. Promising methods for cross-sectional data include damped causality, simulated interaction, structured analogies, and judgmental decomposition; for time series data, they include segmentation, rule-based forecasting, damped seasonality, decomposition by causal forces, damped trend with analogous data, and damped seasonality. The testing of multiple hypotheses has also revealed methods where gains are limited: these include data mining, neural nets, and Box–Jenkins methods. Multiple hypotheses tests should be conducted on widely used but relatively untested methods such as prediction markets, conjoint analysis, diffusion models, and game theory.},

Existing systems aim to maximize effectiveness, efficiency and scalability, but fail to guarantee the interpretability of the results. This hinders their application in critical real scenarios where human comprehension of algorithmic behavior is required. This paper introduces Time2Feat, an end-to-end machine learning system for multivariate time series (MTS) clustering. The system relies on inter-signal and intra-signal interpretable features extracted from the time series. Then, a dimensionality reduction technique is applied to select a subset of features that retain most of the information, thus enhancing the interpretability of the results. In addition, domain experts can semi-supervise the process, by providing a small amount of MTS with a target cluster. This process further improves both accuracy and interpretability, narrowing down the number of features used by the clustering process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, interpretability, efficiency, and robustness of Time2Feat through experiments on eighteen benchmarking time series datasets, comparing them with state-of-the-art MTS clustering methods.},

  abstract = {We describe matrix computations available in the cluster programming framework, Apache Spark. Out of the box, Spark provides abstractions and implementations for distributed matrices and optimization routines using these matrices. When translating single-node algorithms to run on a distributed cluster, we observe that often a simple idea is enough: separating matrix operations from vector operations and shipping the matrix operations to be ran on the cluster, while keeping vector operations local to the driver. In the case of the Singular Value Decomposition, by taking this idea to an extreme, we are able to exploit the computational power of a cluster, while running code written decades ago for a single core. Another example is our Spark port of the popular TFOCS optimization package, originally built for MATLAB, which allows for solving Linear programs as well as a variety of other convex programs. We conclude with a comprehensive set of benchmarks for hardware accelerated matrix computations from the JVM, which is interesting in its own right, as many cluster programming frameworks use the JVM. The contributions described in this paper are already merged into Apache Spark and available on Spark installations by default, and commercially supported by a slew of companies which provide further services.},

  abstract = {We study the factors affecting training time in multi-device deep learning systems. Given a specification of a convolutional neural network, our goal is to minimize the time to train this model on a cluster of commodity CPUs and GPUs. We first focus on the single-node setting and show that by using standard batching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least 5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training speed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its underlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black box. Our second contribution is a theoretical and empirical study of the tradeoffs affecting end-to-end training time in a multiple-device setting. We identify the degree of asynchronous parallelization as a key factor affecting both hardware and statistical efficiency. We see that asynchrony can be viewed as introducing a momentum term. Our results imply that tuning momentum is critical in asynchronous parallel configurations, and suggest that published results that have not been fully tuned might report suboptimal performance for some configurations. For our third contribution, we use our novel understanding of the interaction between system and optimization dynamics to provide an efficient hyperparameter optimizer. Our optimizer involves a predictive model for the total time to convergence and selects an allocation of resources to minimize that time. We demonstrate that the most popular distributed deep learning systems fall within our tradeoff space, but do not optimize within the space. By doing this optimization, our prototype runs 1.9x to 12x faster than the fastest state-of-the-art systems.},

  abstract = {Optimal decision-making compels us to anticipate the future at different horizons. However, in many domains connecting together predictions from multiple time horizons and abstractions levels across their organization becomes all the more important, else decision-makers would be planning using separate and possibly conflicting views of the future. This notably applies to smart grid operation. To optimally manage energy flows in such systems, accurate and coherent predictions must be made across varying aggregation levels and horizons. With this work, we propose a novel multi-dimensional hierarchical forecasting method built upon structurally-informed machine-learning regressors and established hierarchical reconciliation taxonomy. A generic formulation of multi-dimensional hierarchies, reconciling spatial and temporal hierarchies under a common frame is initially defined. Next, a coherency-informed hierarchical learner is developed built upon a custom loss function leveraging optimal reconciliation methods. Coherency of the produced hierarchical forecasts is then secured using similar reconciliation technics. The outcome is a unified and coherent forecast across all examined dimensions. The method is evaluated on two different case studies to predict building electrical loads across spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal hierarchies. Although the regressor natively profits from computationally efficient learning, results displayed disparate performances, demonstrating the value of hierarchical-coherent learning in only one setting. Yet, supported by a comprehensive result analysis, existing obstacles were clearly delineated, presenting distinct pathways for future work. Overall, the paper expands and unites traditionally disjointed hierarchical forecasting methods providing a fertile route toward a novel generation of forecasting regressors.},

Over the years, different tasks such as classification, forecasting and clustering have been proposed to analyze this type of data. Time series data have been also used to study the effect of interventions overtime. Moreover, in many fields of science, learning the causal structure of dynamic systems and time series data is considered an interesting task which plays an important role in scientific discoveries. Estimating the effect of an intervention and identifying the causal relations from the data can be performed via causal inference. Existing surveys on time series discuss traditional tasks such as classification and forecasting or explain the details of the approaches proposed to solve a specific task. In this paper, we focus on two causal inference tasks, i.e., treatment effect estimation and causal discovery for time series data and provide a comprehensive review of the approaches in each task. Furthermore, we curate a list of commonly used evaluation metrics and datasets for each task and provide an in-depth insight.

They provide more reliable causal estimates than conventional two-way fixed effects models when treatment effects are heterogeneous or unobserved time-varying confounders exist. Moreover, we propose a new dynamic treatment effects plot, along with several diagnostic tests, to help researchers gauge the validity of the identifying assumptions. We illustrate these methods with two political economy examples and develop an open-source package, fect, in both R and Stata to facilitate implementation.},

By casting Bayesian time-series analyses as temporal belief-network problems, we introduce dependency models that capture richer and more realistic models of dynamic dependencies. With richer models and associated computational methods, we can move beyond the rigid classical assumptions of linearity in the relationships among variables and of normality of their probability distributions. We apply the methodology to the difficult problem of predicting outcome in critically ill patients. The nonlinear, dynamic behavior of the critical-care domain highlights the need for a synthesis of probability forecasting and uncertain reasoning.},

  abstract = {We consider forecasting a single time series when there is a large number of predictors and a possible nonlinear effect. The dimensionality was first reduced via a high-dimensional factor model implemented by the principal component analysis. Using the extracted factors, we develop a novel forecasting method called the sufficient forecasting, which provides a set of sufficient predictive indices, inferred from high-dimensional predictors, to deliver additional predictive power. The projected principal component analysis will be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a semi-parametric factor model is assumed. Our method is also applicable to cross-sectional sufficient regression using extracted factors. The connection between the sufficient forecasting and the deep learning architecture is explicitly stated. The sufficient forecasting correctly estimates projection indices of the underlying factors even in the presence of a nonparametric forecasting function. The proposed method extends the sufficient dimension reduction to high-dimensional regimes by condensing the cross-sectional information through factor models. We derive asymptotic properties for the estimate of the central subspace spanned by these projection directions as well as the estimates of the sufficient predictive indices. We further show that the natural method of running multiple regression of target on estimated factors yields a linear estimate that actually falls into this central subspace. Our method and theory allow the number of predictors to be larger than the number of observations. We finally demonstrate that the sufficient forecasting improves upon the linear forecasting in both simulation studies and an empirical study of forecasting macroeconomic variables.},

  abstract = {Many internet platforms that collect behavioral big data use it to predict user behavior for internal purposes and for their business customers (e.g., advertisers, insurers, security forces, governments, political consulting firms) who utilize the predictions for personalization, targeting, and other decision-making. Improving predictive accuracy is therefore extremely valuable. Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better prediction accuracy by pushing users’ behaviors towards their predicted values, using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more certain predictions. Such apparent “improved” prediction can result from employing reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl’s causal do(.) operator into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error given behavior modification and identify the components impacting predictive power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the humans whose behavior is manipulated. Behavior modification can make users’ behavior more predictable and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent predictability might not generalize when business customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed towards their predictions can be at odds with customers’ intentions, and harmful to manipulated users.},

In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing forecasting approaches for intermittent demand from academic and practical perspectives. However, limited attention has been given to forecast combination methods, which have achieved competitive performance in forecasting fast-moving time series. The current study aims to examine the empirical outcomes of some existing forecast combination methods and propose a generalized feature-based framework for intermittent demand forecasting. The proposed framework has been shown to improve the accuracy of point and quantile forecasts based on two real data sets. Further, some analysis of features, forecasting pools and computational efficiency is also provided. The findings indicate the intelligibility and flexibility of the proposed approach in intermittent demand forecasting and offer insights regarding inventory decisions.},

  abstract = {The practical importance of coherent forecasts in hierarchical forecasting has inspired many studies on forecast reconciliation. Under this approach, so-called base forecasts are produced for every series in the hierarchy and are subsequently adjusted to be coherent in a second reconciliation step. Reconciliation methods have been shown to improve forecast accuracy, but will, in general, adjust the base forecast of every series. However, in an operational context, it is sometimes necessary or beneficial to keep forecasts of some variables unchanged after forecast reconciliation. In this paper, we formulate reconciliation methodology that keeps forecasts of a pre-specified subset of variables unchanged or "immutable". In contrast to existing approaches, these immutable forecasts need not all come from the same level of a hierarchy, and our method can also be applied to grouped hierarchies. We prove that our approach preserves unbiasedness in base forecasts. Our method can also account for correlations between base forecasting errors and ensure non-negativity of forecasts. We also perform empirical experiments, including an application to sales of a large scale online retailer, to assess the impacts of our proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new univariate forecasting method. The method is based on the concept of modifying the local curvature of the time-series through a coefficient 'Theta' (the Greek letter u), that is applied directly to the second differences of the data. The resulting series that are created maintain the mean and the slope of the original data but not their curvatures. These new time series are named Theta-lines. Their primary qualitative characteristic is the improvement of the approximation of the long-term behavior of the data or the augmentation of the short-term features, depending on the value of the Theta coefficient. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into two or more different Theta-lines. These are extrapolated separately and the subsequent forecasts are combined. The simple combination of two Theta-lines, the Theta 5 0 (straight line) and Theta 5 2 (double local curves) was adopted in order to produce forecasts for the 3003 series of the M3 competition. The method performed well, particularly for monthly series and for microeconomic data.},

M5 focused on a retail sales forecasting application with the objective to produce the most accurate point forecasts for 42,840 time series that represent the hierarchical unit sales of the largest retail company in the world, Walmart, as well as to provide the most accurate estimates of the uncertainty of these forecasts. Hence, the competition consisted of two parallel challenges, namely the Accuracy and Uncertainty forecasting competitions. M5 extended the results of the previous M competitions by: (a) significantly expanding the number of participating methods, especially those in the category of machine learning; (b) evaluating the performance of the uncertainty distribution along with point forecast accuracy; (c) including exogenous/explanatory variables in addition to the time series data; (d) using grouped, correlated time series; and (e) focusing on series that display intermittency. This paper describes the background, organization, and implementations of the competition, and it presents the data used and their characteristics. Consequently, it serves as introductory material to the results of the two forecasting challenges to facilitate their understanding.},

Combining multiple forecasts produced for a target time series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby avoiding the need to identify a single “best” forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation to sophisticated techniques involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations and a reference to available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations of various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some crucial issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future research.},

The most important theoretical advance is the invention of a complete statistical rationale for exponential smoothing based on a new class of state-space models with a single source of error. The most important practical advance is the development of a robust method for smoothing damped multiplicative trends. We also have a new adaptive method for simple smoothing, the first such method to demonstrate credible improved forecast accuracy over fixed-parameter smoothing. Longstanding confusion in the literature about whether and how to renormalize seasonal indices in the Holt–Winters methods has finally been resolved. There has been significant work in forecasting for inventory control, including the development of new predictive distributions for total lead-time demand and several improved versions of Croston's method for forecasting intermittent time series. Regrettably, there has been little progress in the identification and selection of exponential smoothing methods. The research in this area is best described as inconclusive, and it is still difficult to beat the application of a damped trend to every time series.},

Unlike the state-of-the-art, the proposed method simultaneously learns from all time series in the hierarchy and incorporates the reconciliation step into a single trainable model. This is achieved by applying the reparameterization trick and casting reconciliation as an optimization problem with a closed-form solution. These model features make end-to-end learning of hierarchical forecasts possible, while accomplishing the challenging task of generating forecasts that are both probabilistic and coherent. Importantly, our approach also accommodates general aggregation constraints including grouped and temporal hierarchies. An extensive empirical evaluation on real-world hierarchical datasets demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.},

The first algorithm is a standard averaging method that distributes the N data samples evenly to m machines, performs separate minimization on each subset, and then averages the estimates. We provide a sharp analysis of this average mixture algorithm, showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter achieves mean-squared error (MSE) that decays as O(N-1 +(N/m)-2). Whenever m ≤ √N, this guarantee matches the best possible rate achievable by a centralized algorithm having access to all N samples. The second algorithm is a novel method, based on an appropriate form of bootstrap subsampling. Requiring only a single round of communication, it has mean-squared error that decays as O(N-1 + (N/m)-3), and so is more robust to the amount of parallelization. In addition, we show that a stochastic gradient-based method attains mean-squared error decaying as O(N-1 + (N/m)-3/2), easing computation at the expense of a potentially slower MSE rate. We also provide an experimental evaluation of our methods, investigating their performance both on simulated data and on a large-scale regression problem from the internet search domain. In particular, we show that our methods can be used to efficiently solve an advertisement prediction problem from the Chinese SoSo Search Engine, which involves logistic regression with N ≈ 2.4×108 samples and d ≈ 740,000 covariates.},

Extensive research focuses on improving the accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom levels. Then, hierarchical reconciliation can be used to improve the overall performance further. In this paper, we present a hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment approach that treats the bottom-level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach, N-BEATS, for continuous time series at the top levels, and a widely used tree-based algorithm, LightGBM, for intermittent time series at the bottom level. The hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment approach is a simple yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business orientated and can be used to facilitate strategic business planning.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is fundamental for various use cases in different domains such as energy systems and economics. Creating a forecasting model for a specific use case requires an iterative and complex design process. The typical design process includes five sections (1) data preprocessing, (2) feature engineering, (3) hyperparameter optimization, (4) forecasting method selection, and (5) forecast ensembling, which are commonly organized in a pipeline structure. One promising approach to handle the ever-growing demand for time series forecasts is automating this design process. The article, thus, reviews existing literature on automated time series forecasting pipelines and analyzes how the design process of forecasting models is currently automated. Thereby, we consider both automated machine learning (AutoML) and automated statistical forecasting methods in a single forecasting pipeline. For this purpose, we first present and compare the identified automation methods for each pipeline section. Second, we analyze these automation methods regarding their interaction, combination, and coverage of the five pipeline sections. For both, we discuss the reviewed literature that contributes toward automating the design process, identify problems, give recommendations, and suggest future research. This review reveals that the majority of the reviewed literature only covers two or three of the five pipeline sections. We conclude that future research has to holistically consider the automation of the forecasting pipeline to enable the large-scale application of time series forecasting.

New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology] and demonstrates their improvement over homogeneous Markov random graph models in fitting empirical network data. Not only do the new specifications show improvements in goodness of fit for various data sets, but they also help to avoid the problem of near-degeneracy that often afflicts the fitting of Markov random graph models in practice, particularly to network data exhibiting high levels of transitivity. The inclusion of a new higher order transitivity statistic allows estimation of parameters of exponential graph models for many (but not all) cases where it is impossible to estimate parameters of homogeneous Markov graph models. The new specifications were used to model a large number of classical small-scale network data sets and showed a dramatically better performance than Markov graph models. We also review three current programs for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and we compare these Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimates with less accurate pseudo-likelihood estimates. Finally, we discuss whether homogeneous Markov random graph models may be superseded by the new specifications, and how additional elaborations may further improve model performance.},

Prior information takes the form of benchmarks. These originate from the advice of experts, from forecasts of an annual econometric model or simply from pessimistic, realistic or optimistic scenarios contemplated by the analyst of the current economic situation. The benchmarks may represent annual levels to be achieved, neighbourhoods to be reached for a given time period, movements to be displayed or more generally any linear criteria to be satisfied by the forecasted values. The forecaster may then exercise his current economic evaluation and judgement to the fullest extent in deriving forecasts, since the laboriousness experienced without a systematic method is avoided.},

Berger (2000) documents the increase in Bayesian activity by the number of published research articles, the number of books,andtheextensivenumberofapplicationsofBayesianarticlesinapplied disciplines such as science and engineering. One reason for the dramatic growth in Bayesian modeling is the availab- ity of computational algorithms to compute the range of integrals that are necessary in a Bayesian posterior analysis. Due to the speed of modern c- puters, it is now possible to use the Bayesian paradigm to ?t very complex models that cannot be ?t by alternative frequentist methods. To ?t Bayesian models, one needs a statistical computing environment. This environment should be such that one can: write short scripts to de?ne a Bayesian model use or write functions to summarize a posterior distribution use functions to simulate from the posterior distribution construct graphs to illustrate the posterior inference An environment that meets these requirements is the R system. R provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical d- plays. Moreover, it includes a well-developed, simple programming language that users can extend by adding new functions. Many such extensions of the language in the form of packages are easily downloadable from the Comp- hensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

It also assesses some newly proposed semiparametric estimation procedures for time series data with long-range dependence. Even though the book only deals with climatological and financial data, the estimation and specifications methods discussed can be applied to models with real-world data in many disciplines.This resource covers key methods in time series analysis and provides the necessary theoretical details.

Models of this type provide a convenient mechanism for accommodating the interconnectedness and temporal co-variability that are often present in large dimensional systems. We propose an ℓ1-nuclear-norm regularized estimator and derive the non-asymptotic upper bounds for the estimation errors as well as large sample asymptotics for the estimates. A singular value thresholding procedure is used to determine the correct number of factors with probability approaching one. Both the LASSO estimator and the conservative LASSO estimator are employed to improve estimation precision. The conservative LASSO estimates of the non-zero coefficients are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the oracle least squares estimates. Simulations demonstrate that our estimators perform reasonably well in finite samples given the complex high-dimensional nature of the model. In an empirical illustration we apply the methodology to explore dynamic connectedness in the volatilities of financial asset prices and the transmission of ‘investor fear’. The findings reveal that a large proportion of connectedness is due to the common factors. Conditional on the presence of these common factors, the results still document remarkable connectedness due to the interactions between the individual variables, thereby supporting a common factor augmented VAR specification.},

The resulting Bayesian additive vector autoregressive tree (BAVART) model is capable of capturing arbitrary nonlinear relations between the endogenous variables and the covariates without much input from the researcher. Since controlling for heteroscedasticity is key for producing precise density forecasts, our model allows for stochastic volatility in the errors. We apply our model to two datasets. The first application shows that the BAVART model yields highly competitive forecasts of the U.S. term structure of interest rates. In a second application we estimate our model using a moderately sized Eurozone dataset to investigate the dynamic effects of uncertainty on the economy.},

However, it involves too many parameters when the number of time series and lag order are even moderately large. This article proposes to rearrange the transition matrices of the model into a tensor form such that the parameter space can be restricted along three directions simultaneously via tensor decomposition. In contrast, the reduced-rank regression method can restrict the parameter space in only one direction. Besides achieving substantial dimension reduction, the proposed model is interpretable from the factor modeling perspective. Moreover, to handle high-dimensional time series, this article considers imposing sparsity on factor matrices to improve the model interpretability and estimation efficiency, which leads to a sparsity-inducing estimator. For the low-dimensional case, we derive asymptotic properties of the proposed least squares estimator and introduce an alternating least squares algorithm. For the high-dimensional case, we establish nonasymptotic properties of the sparsity-inducing estimator and propose an ADMM algorithm for regularized estimation. Simulation experiments and a real data example demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over various existing methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We then highlight recent bootstrap computational approaches to approximating loss-driven posteriors. In particular, we focus on implicit bootstrap distributions defined through an underlying push-forward mapping. We investigate independent, identically distributed (iid) samplers from approximate posteriors that pass random bootstrap weights through a trained generative network. After training the deep-learning mapping, the simulation cost of such iid samplers is negligible. We compare the performance of these deep bootstrap samplers with exact bootstrap as well as MCMC on several examples (including support vector machines or quantile regression). We also provide theoretical insights into bootstrap posteriors by drawing upon connections to model mis-specification.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

(doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa008)), which is a spike-and-slab shrinkage prior where the spike probability is stochastically increasing and constructed from the stick-breaking representation of a Dirichlet process prior. As a first contribution, this CUSP prior is extended by involving arbitrary stick-breaking representations arising from beta distributions. As a second contribution, we prove that exchangeable spike-and-slab priors, which are popular and widely used in sparse Bayesian factor analysis, can be represented as a finite generalized CUSP prior, which is easily obtained from the decreasing order statistics of the slab probabilities. Hence, exchangeable spike-and-slab shrinkage priors imply increasing shrinkage as the column index in the loading matrix increases, without imposing explicit order constraints on the slab probabilities. An application to sparse Bayesian factor analysis illustrates the usefulness of the findings of this paper. A new exchangeable spike-and-slab shrinkage prior based on the triple gamma prior of Cadonna et al. (Cadonna et al. 2020 Econometrics8, 20.

The posterior law on the unknown distribution is centred on the predictive distribution and we prove that it is marginally asymptotically Gaussian with variance depending on the predictive updates, i.e. on how the predictive rule incorporates information as new observations become available. This allows to obtain asymptotic credible intervals only based on the predictive rule (without having to specify the model and the prior law), sheds light on frequentist coverage as related to the predictive learning rule, and, we believe, opens a new perspective towards a notion of predictive efficiency that seems to call for further research.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

A popular model for such data is the hurdle model, which explicitly models the probability of a zero count, while assuming a sampling distribution on the positive integers. We consider data from multiple count processes. In this context, it is of interest to study the patterns of counts and cluster the subjects accordingly. We introduce a novel Bayesian approach to cluster multiple, possibly related, zero-inflated processes. We propose a joint model for zero-inflated counts, specifying a hurdle model for each process with a shifted Negative Binomial sampling distribution. Conditionally on the model parameters, the different processes are assumed independent, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of parameters as compared with traditional multivariate approaches. The subject-specific probabilities of zero-inflation and the parameters of the sampling distribution are flexibly modelled via an enriched finite mixture with random number of components. This induces a two-level clustering of the subjects based on the zero/non-zero patterns (outer clustering) and on the sampling distribution (inner clustering). Posterior inference is performed through tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes. We demonstrate the proposed approach on an application involving the use of the messaging service WhatsApp.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

Combined with neural networks to improve their expressivity, the resulting deep latent variable models have also found numerous applications in machine learning. A drawback of these models is that their likelihood function is intractable so approximations have to be carried out to perform inference. A standard approach consists of maximizing instead an evidence lower bound (ELBO) obtained based on a variational approximation of the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The standard ELBO can, however, be a very loose bound if the variational family is not rich enough. A generic strategy to tighten such bounds is to rely on an unbiased low-variance Monte Carlo estimate of the evidence.

Recently, there is a movement to use real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records, patient registries, claims data and other sources in lieu of or supplementing controlled clinical trials. This process of combining information from diverse sources calls for inference under a Bayesian paradigm. We review some of the currently used methods and a novel non-parametric Bayesian (BNP) method. Carrying out the desired adjustment for differences in patient populations is naturally done with BNP priors that facilitate understanding of and adjustment for population heterogeneities across different data sources. We discuss the particular problem of using RWD to create a synthetic control arm to supplement single-arm treatment only studies. At the core of the proposed approach is the model-based adjustment to achieve equivalent patient populations in the current study and the (adjusted) RWD. This is implemented using common atoms mixture models. The structure of such models greatly simplifies inference. The adjustment for differences in the populations can be reduced to ratios of weights in such mixtures.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

Historically, however, most feature-based fields of forensic science, including firearms examination and latent print analysis, have not been shown to be scientifically valid. Recently, black-box studies have been proposed as a means of assessing whether these feature-based disciplines are valid, at least in terms of accuracy, reproducibility and repeatability. In these studies, forensic examiners frequently either do not respond to every test item or select an answer equivalent to ‘don’t know’. Current black-box studies do not account for these high levels of missingness in statistical analyses. Unfortunately, the authors of black-box studies typically do not share the data necessary to meaningfully adjust estimates for the high proportion of missing responses. Borrowing from work in the context of small area estimation, we propose the use of hierarchical Bayesian models that do not require auxiliary data to adjust for non-response. Using these models, we offer the first formal exploration of the impact that missingness is playing in error rate estimations reported in black-box studies. We show that error rates currently reported as low as 0.4\% could actually be at least 8.4\% in models accounting for non-response where inconclusive decisions are counted as correct, and over 28\% when inconclusives are counted as missing responses. These proposed models are not the answer to the missingness problem in black-box studies. But with the release of auxiliary information, they can be the foundation for new methodologies to adjust for missingness in error rate estimations.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

  abstract = {In statistical inference, uncertainty is unknown and all models are wrong. That is to say, a person who makes a statistical model and a prior distribution is simultaneously aware that both are fictional candidates. To study such cases, statistical measures have been constructed, such as cross validation, information criteria and marginal likelihood; however, their mathematical properties have not yet been completely clarified when statistical models are under- or over-parametrized. We introduce a place of mathematical theory of Bayesian statistics for unknown uncertainty, which clarifies general properties of cross validation, information criteria and marginal likelihood, even if an unknown data-generating process is unrealizable by a model or even if the posterior distribution cannot be approximated by any normal distribution. Hence it gives a helpful standpoint for a person who cannot believe in any specific model and prior. This paper consists of three parts. The first is a new result, whereas the second and third are well-known previous results with new experiments. We show there exists a more precise estimator of the generalization loss than leave-one-out cross validation, there exists a more accurate approximation of marginal likelihood than Bayesian information criterion, and the optimal hyperparameters for generalization loss and marginal likelihood are different.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.},

To tackle the massive rare events data, we propose a novel distributed estimation method for logistic regression in a distributed system. For a distributed framework, we face the following two challenges. The first challenge is how to distribute the data. In this regard, two different distribution strategies (i.e., the RANDOM strategy and the COPY strategy) are investigated. The second challenge is how to select an appropriate type of objective function so that the best asymptotic efficiency can be achieved. Then, the under-sampled (US) and inverse probability weighted (IPW) types of objective functions are considered. Our results suggest that the COPY strategy together with the IPW objective function is the best solution for distributed logistic regression with rare events. The finite sample performance of the distributed methods is demonstrated by simulation studies and a real-world Sweden Traffic Sign dataset.},

Focused on multivariate revenue forecasting across collections of supermarkets and product categories, hierarchical dynamic models are natural: these are able to couple revenue streams in an integrated forecasting model, while allowing conditional decoupling to enable relevant and sensitive analysis together with scalable computation. Structured models exploit multi-scale modeling to cascade information on price and promotion activities as predictors relevant across categories and groups of stores. With a context-relevant focus on forecasting revenue 12 weeks ahead, the study highlights product categories that benefit from multi-scale information, defines insights into when, how, and why multivariate models improve forecast accuracy, and shows how cross-category dependencies can relate to promotion decisions in one category impacting others.

After graduating with honors in 1946 from the Russian School in Harbin, he studied electrical engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology during 1947-1949. In 1949 he emigrated to Israel, where, after two years of military service, he studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, obtaining an M.A. with honors in Mathematics in 1956. Following two years at the Israeli Meteorological Service, he entered graduate school at Cornell University and obtained a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics in 1960. After research positions at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the University of Toronto, he joined the latter institution as an Associate Professor in 1964. He moved to Temple University, Philadelphia, in 1967 as Professor of Mathematics and then to the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1979 as Professor in the College of Business and Management. He took early retirement and moved to George Washington University in 1997. Samuel Kotz has made substantial contributions in several areas of statistics--including systems of distributions, measures of dependence, multivariate analysis, characterizations, limit distributions, replacement theory, quality control, information theory and applications of statistics. He is the senior coeditor-in-chief of the thirteen-volume Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences, an author or coauthor of over one hundred and fifty articles on statistical methodology and theory, twelve books in the field of statistics and quality control and three Russian-English scientific dictionaries and coauthor of the often-cited compendium of statistical distributions. His efforts, excellence and contributions were recognized by the award of honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology (China) in 1988, from the University of Athens (Greece) in 1995 and from Bowling Green State University (Ohio, U.S.A.) in 1997. In 1997 a volume containing thirty-eight essays was published in honor of his sixty-fifth birthday. He was awarded membership in the Washington Academy of Sciences in 1998.

In the first stage we adopt a group selection principle to consistently identify the number of subgroups, while in the second stage change point locations and model parameter estimates are refined by a penalized induced smoothing technique. Our procedure allows sparse solutions for relatively moderate- or high-dimensional covariates. We further establish the asymptotic properties of our proposed estimators under appropriate technical conditions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by simulation studies and provide illustrations using two medical data examples. Our proposal for subgroup identification may lead to an immediate application in personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {The second edition of a comprehensive state-of-the-art graduate level text on microeconometric methods, substantially revised and updated.The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers’ questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

To this end, our approach has better interpretability compared to other black-box forecasting combination schemes. We apply our framework to stock market data and M3 competition data. Based on our structure, a simple maximum-a-posteriori scheme outperforms benchmark methods, and Bayesian variable selection can further enhance the accuracy for both point forecasts and density forecasts.},

This paper develops a novel distributed forecasting framework to tackle the challenges of forecasting ultra-long time series using the industry-standard MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach retains the local time dependency. It utilizes a straightforward splitting across samples to facilitate distributed forecasting by combining the local estimators of time series models delivered from worker nodes and minimizing a global loss function. Instead of unrealistically assuming the data generating process (DGP) of an ultra-long time series stays invariant, we only make assumptions on the DGP of subseries spanning shorter time periods. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach with AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models using the real data application as well as numerical simulations. Our approach improves forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency in point forecasts and prediction intervals, especially for longer forecast horizons, compared to directly fitting the whole data with ARIMA models. Moreover, we explore some potential factors that may affect the forecasting performance of our approach.},

The method allows us to leverage the adaptivity, regularization and predictive power of nonparametric Bayesian procedures to estimate low-dimensional functionals of interest without being restricted by the holistic Bayesian formalism. Starting from a conventional nonparametric posterior, we target the functional of interest by transforming the entire distribution with a Bayesian bootstrap correction. We provide conditions for the resulting \$\textbackslash textit\{one-step posterior\}\$ to possess calibrated frequentist properties and specialize the results for several canonical examples: the integrated squared density, the mean of a missing-at-random outcome, and the average causal treatment effect on the treated. The procedure is computationally attractive, requiring only a simple, efficient post-processing step that can be attached onto any arbitrary posterior sampling algorithm. Using the ACIC 2016 causal data analysis competition, we illustrate that our approach can outperform the existing state-of-the-art through the propagation of Bayesian uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Forecast combination is widely recognized as a preferred strategy over forecast selection due to its ability to mitigate the uncertainty associated with identifying a single "best" forecast. Nonetheless, sophisticated combinations are often empirically dominated by simple averaging, which is commonly attributed to the weight estimation error. The issue becomes more problematic when dealing with a forecast pool containing a large number of individual forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecast trimming algorithm to identify an optimal subset from the original forecast pool for forecast combination tasks. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed algorithm simultaneously takes into account the robustness, accuracy and diversity issues of the forecast pool, rather than isolating each one of these issues. We also develop five forecast trimming algorithms as benchmarks, including one trimming-free algorithm and several trimming algorithms that isolate each one of the three key issues. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves superior forecasting performance in general in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. Nevertheless, we argue that diversity does not always have to be addressed in forecast trimming. Based on the results, we offer some practical guidelines on the selection of forecast trimming algorithms for a target series.},

However, the majority of research has focused on point forecasting, with little exploration into probabilistic intermittent demand forecasting. This is despite the fact that probabilistic forecasting is crucial for effective decision-making under uncertainty and inventory management. Additionally, most literature on this topic has focused solely on forecasting performance and has overlooked the inventory implications, which are directly relevant to intermittent demand. To address these gaps, this study aims to construct probabilistic forecasting combinations for intermittent demand while considering both forecasting accuracy and inventory control utility in obtaining combinations and evaluating forecasts. Our empirical findings demonstrate that combinations perform better than individual approaches for forecasting intermittent demand, but there is a trade-off between forecasting and inventory performance.},

For this purpose, we establish a data-driven environment by downloading \$43\$ years of hourly global weather data from the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and train a few deep neural networks with about \$256\$ million parameters in total. The spatial resolution of forecast is \$0.25\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\textbackslash times0.25\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\$, comparable to the ECMWF Integrated Forecast Systems (IFS). More importantly, for the first time, an AI-based method outperforms state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods in terms of accuracy (latitude-weighted RMSE and ACC) of all factors (e.g., geopotential, specific humidity, wind speed, temperature, etc.) and in all time ranges (from one hour to one week). There are two key strategies to improve the prediction accuracy: (i) designing a 3D Earth Specific Transformer (3DEST) architecture that formulates the height (pressure level) information into cubic data, and (ii) applying a hierarchical temporal aggregation algorithm to alleviate cumulative forecast errors. In deterministic forecast, Pangu-Weather shows great advantages for short to medium-range forecast (i.e., forecast time ranges from one hour to one week). Pangu-Weather supports a wide range of downstream forecast scenarios, including extreme weather forecast (e.g., tropical cyclone tracking) and large-member ensemble forecast in real-time. Pangu-Weather not only ends the debate on whether AI-based methods can surpass conventional NWP methods, but also reveals novel directions for improving deep learning weather forecast systems.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular methods for dimension reduction. In light of the rapidly growing large-scale data in federated ecosystems, the traditional PCA method is often not applicable due to privacy protection considerations and large computational burden. Algorithms were proposed to lower the computational cost, but few can handle both high dimensionality and massive sample size under the distributed setting. In this paper, we propose the FAst DIstributed (FADI) PCA method for federated data when both the dimension \$d\$ and the sample size \$n\$ are ultra-large, by simultaneously performing parallel computing along \$d\$ and distributed computing along \$n\$. Specifically, we utilize \$L\$ parallel copies of \$p\$-dimensional fast sketches to divide the computing burden along \$d\$ and aggregate the results distributively along the split samples. We present FADI under a general framework applicable to multiple statistical problems, and establish comprehensive theoretical results under the general framework. We show that FADI enjoys the same non-asymptotic error rate as the traditional PCA when \$Lp \textbackslash ge d\$. We also derive inferential results that characterize the asymptotic distribution of FADI, and show a phase-transition phenomenon as \$Lp\$ increases. We perform extensive simulations to show that FADI substantially outperforms the existing methods in computational efficiency while preserving accuracy, and validate the distributional phase-transition phenomenon through numerical experiments. We apply FADI to the 1000 Genomes data to study the population structure.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem – model, parameters, latent states – is able to be quantified explicitly and factored into the forecast distribution via the process of integration or averaging. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large or complex. The current state of play in Bayesian forecasting in economics and finance is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide the reader with an overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context, with sufficient computational detail given to assist the reader with implementation.},

This perspective enables us to reason about the effects of changes to this process (interventions) and what would have happened in hindsight (counterfactuals). We categorize work in CausalML into five groups according to the problems they address: (1) causal supervised learning, (2) causal generative modeling, (3) causal explanations, (4) causal fairness, and (5) causal reinforcement learning. We systematically compare the methods in each category and point out open problems. Further, we review data-modality-specific applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph representation learning. Finally, we provide an overview of causal benchmarks and a critical discussion of the state of this nascent field, including recommendations for future work.},

In each case, our data-augmentation strategy leads to simple, effective methods for posterior inference that (1) circumvent the need for analytic approximations, numerical integration, or Metropolis–Hastings; and (2) outperform other known data-augmentation strategies, both in ease of use and in computational efficiency. All methods, including an efficient sampler for the Pólya–Gamma distribution, are implemented in the R package BayesLogit. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Model selection has been proven an effective strategy for improving accuracy in time series forecasting applications. However, when dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting model, forecasters have also to select a suitable method for reconciling the base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent. Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting reconciliation method and leading to more accurate coherent forecasts. The approach, which we call conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on machine learning classification methods that use time series features to select the reconciliation method for each hierarchy. Moreover, it allows the selection to be tailored according to the accuracy measure of preference and the hierarchical level(s) of interest. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting can lead to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels.},

  abstract = {Med utviklinga av avanserte datainnsamlingsteknikkar og digitalisering, har omfanget av tilgjengelig data i ulike fagfelt auka enormt. Det blir difor stadig viktigare med effektive og nøyaktige algoritmar innan statistisk modellering, og denne avhandlinga inneheld bidrag til dette. Bidraga kan kategoriserast i to hovudtema: glisne (sparse) Bayesianske metodar og statistiske levetidsmodellar.    Glisne Bayesianske metodar har fått auka interesse dei siste åra, mellom anna på grunn av at dei produserer modellar som generaliserer godt og som er robuste mot data som inneheld mykje støy. Det finst mange ulike variantar av Bayesianske metodar, som til dømes metodar som brukar Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Denne avhandlinga fokuserer på den empirisk Bayesianske tilnærminga. Avhandlinga undersøker både nye glisne Bayesianske modellar og ein ny generell løysingsstrategi for desse modellane. I den nye løysingsstrategien brukar ein R-pakken, Template Model Builder (TMB), til å optimere modellparametrane ved å bruke automatisk derivasjon. Ein algoritme som forbetrar kjøretida for estimering av dei latente variablene i TMB, vert også presentert. Ved å bruke denne algoritmen oppnår ein tilnærma lik tidsbruk ved å bruke TMB som dei orginale algoritmane for desse Bayesianske modellane. Løysingsstrategien gjer det enkelt å justere modellane utan å måtte utleie nye komplekse algoritmar, og dette blir demonstrert ved å bruke den på nye glisne Bayesianske modellar. I tillegg til modellane som er utleia i det nye løysingsrammeverket, inneheld avhandlinga også ei analytisk løysing til ein ny modell som er relatert til Bayesiansk lasso. I motsetning til Bayesiansk lasso, gir den nye modellen glisne løysingar og kan også bli brukt til å løyse ikkje-lineære regresjonsproblem.    Det andre temaet for denne avhandlinga er statistiske levetidsmodellar. Her blir det presenterer ei ny multivariat fordeling for å modellere avhengige levetider, som blir kalla søskenfordelinga. Fordelinga blir definert ut frå levetida for søsken, der avhengighetsstrukturen blir indusert gjennom felles mor. Søskenfordelinga blir konstruert slik at komponentane som er knytt til mor er inkludert som latente variablar, og ein treng difor ingen informasjon om henne. Sjølv om fordelinga vert presentert som ei fordeling av leveår, kan den bli nytta meir generelt på avhengige komponentar. Vi beviser at den bivariate søskenfordelinga med konstante rater er Multivariate Totally Positive of order two (MTP2), som er ein sterk avhengig eigenskap og indikerer mellom anna ein positiv kovarians. Modellparametrane er fødsels- og dødsratene, i tillegg til dei individuelle tidspunkta for død. Estimering av desse tidspunkta kan ikkje gjerast ved å bruke klassiske estimeringsprosedyrar, då rimelegheitsfunksjonen ikkje er deriverbar med hensyn til desse parametrane. For å løyse dette problemet blir ein iterativ estimeringsalgoritme utvikla, som gjev estimat på alle modellparametrar. Algoritmen blir testa både på simulerte og ekte data. Resultata viser at estimerte verdiar ligg tett opptil dei sanne verdiane ved testing på simulerte data.},

  abstract = {Life expectancy has been increasing sharply around the globe since the second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970–2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated.},

Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10.

  abstract = {Time series is the major source of information to study characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which is frequently dominated by various types of events embedded in the time series with different levels of noise. To understand physical dynamics of the atmospheric turbulence, the individual events need to be detected and studied about their physical and structural characteristics. In spite of the attention that has been given to studying events among the atmospheric sci- ence community, the detection of events still presents a challenge, and thus their characteristics and contributions to the ABL remain poorly understood. Besides the existence of high level noise in turbulence, the main diculty is that many of the events that are responsible for the variability in the atmospheric turbulence time series are previously unknown, especially in the stable ABL. This dissertation develops a new method for detecting and classifying structures from turbulence time series. The main idea of the method is in defining events as time-series subsequences that are significantly different from noise. This switches the focus of the event detection approach towards defining the characteristics of noise, which is in many situations an easier problem than defining a structure. For atmospheric time series, a natural characterization of the noise is red noise, which is a stationary AR(1) process. The proposed method consists of two steps. The first step of the method is event extraction based on noise tests. We perform a noise test on each subsequence extracted from the series using a sliding window. All the subsequences recognized as noise are removed from further analysis, and the events are extracted from the remaining non-noise subsequences. This step does not assume particular geometries or amplitudes of the flow structures. In the second step, the detected structures are classified into groups with similar characteristics. This step groups large numbers of detected events such that it opens a pathway for the detailed study of their characteristics, and helps to gain understanding of events with previously unknown origin. In order to account for the underlying characteristics of the extracted events, a feature-based clustering method is used, which first summarizes each event with its global measures before performing clustering in the feature space. It yields substantially better results than clustering based on raw data of the events. The developed R package TED is tested on artificial time series with different levels of complexity and real world atmospheric turbulence time series. The results on artificial data show that events used to generate the data can be exactly detected and clustered. The method is robust to high levels of noise, which is advantageous regarding very noisy turbulence time series. Application of the method to a well- known real world turbulence dataset demonstrates that the method successfully extracts realistic flow structures, which are in line with previous studies that have examined the underlying physical mechanisms of several isolated events on that dataset. From the application of the method to a more complicated turbulence dataset, about which no published results can be found regarding extraction of unknown events, the proposed method is able to detect and distinguish events with different dynamical characteristics even though the clustering step is only based on statistical measures of characteristics of events from time series.},

  abstract = {Time series analysis is of immense importance in extensive applications, such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and action recognition. This paper focuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of extensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D kernels. Technically, we propose the TimesNet with TimesBlock as a task-general backbone for time series analysis. TimesBlock can discover the multi-periodicity adaptively and extract the complex temporal variations from transformed 2D tensors by a parameter-efficient inception block. Our proposed TimesNet achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.

It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-training performed on one dataset to other datasets also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

  abstract = {Graphical structures estimated by causal learning algorithms from time series data can provide highly misleading causal information if the causal timescale of the generating process fails to match the measurement timescale of the data. Existing algorithms provide limited resources to respond to this challenge, and so researchers must either use models that they know are likely misleading, or else forego causal learning entirely. Existing methods face up-to-four distinct shortfalls, as they might a) require that the difference between causal and measurement timescales is known; b) only handle very small number of random variables when the timescale difference is unknown; c) only apply to pairs of variables (albeit with fewer assumptions about prior knowledge); or d) be unable to find a solution given statistical noise in the data. This paper aims to address these challenges. We present an approach that combines constraint programming with both theoretical insights into the problem structure and prior information about admissible causal interactions to achieve speed up of multiple orders of magnitude. The resulting system scales to significantly larger sets of random variables (\${$>$}100\$) without knowledge of the timescale difference while maintaining theoretical guarantees. This method is also robust to edge misidentification and can use parametric connection strengths, while optionally finding the optimal among many possible solutions.},

While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature, a recent survey concluded that no single method is the most accurate across various datasets. To make matters worse, anomaly labels are scarce and rarely available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the literature. This paper answers this question \textbackslash textit\{i.e.\} Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate model? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics, namely, \textbackslash textit\{prediction error\}, \textbackslash textit\{model centrality\}, and \textbackslash textit\{performance on injected synthetic anomalies\}, and show that some metrics are highly correlated with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the \$F\_1\$ score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach. Large-scale experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised approach is as effective as selecting the most accurate model based on partially labeled data.},

And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2\% and 21.6\% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.},

In particular, Transformer-based models have shown great potential because they can capture long-term dependency. However, existing Transformer-based models mainly focus on modeling the temporal dependency (cross-time dependency) yet often omit the dependency among different variables (cross-dimension dependency), which is critical for MTS forecasting. To fill the gap, we propose Crossformer, a Transformer-based model utilizing cross-dimension dependency for MTS forecasting. In Crossformer, the input MTS is embedded into a 2D vector array through the Dimension-Segment-Wise (DSW) embedding to preserve time and dimension information. Then the Two-Stage Attention (TSA) layer is proposed to efficiently capture the cross-time and cross-dimension dependency. Utilizing DSW embedding and TSA layer, Crossformer establishes a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (HED) to use the information at different scales for the final forecasting. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show the effectiveness of Crossformer against previous state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract = {Deep learning inspired by differential equations is a recent research trend and has marked the state of the art performance for many machine learning tasks. Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths. However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder, i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed. Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5 real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.},

  abstract = {Understanding the latent causal factors of a dynamical system from visual observations is considered a crucial step towards agents reasoning in complex environments. In this paper, we propose CITRIS, a variational autoencoder framework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of images in which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. In contrast to the recent literature, CITRIS exploits temporality and observing intervention targets to identify scalar and multidimensional causal factors, such as 3D rotation angles. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow, CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations obtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results on scalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, in which only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. In experiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methods on recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrained autoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causal factors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causal representation learning.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection within multivariate time series (MTS) is an essential task in both data mining and service quality management. Many recent works on anomaly detection focus on designing unsupervised probabilistic models to extract robust normal patterns of MTS. In this paper, we model sensor dependency and stochasticity within MTS by developing an embedding-guided probabilistic generative network. We combine it with adaptive variational graph convolutional recurrent network \%and get variational GCRN (VGCRN) to model both spatial and temporal fine-grained correlations in MTS. To explore hierarchical latent representations, we further extend VGCRN into a deep variational network, which captures multilevel information at different layers and is robust to noisy time series. Moreover, we develop an upward-downward variational inference scheme that considers both forecasting-based and reconstruction-based losses, achieving an accurate posterior approximation of latent variables with better MTS representations. The experiments verify the superiority of the proposed method over current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised/self-supervised time series representation learning is a challenging problem because of its complex dynamics and sparse annotations. Existing works mainly adopt the framework of contrastive learning with the time-based augmentation techniques to sample positives and negatives for contrastive training. Nevertheless, they mostly use segment-level augmentation derived from time slicing, which may bring about sampling bias and incorrect optimization with false negatives due to the loss of global context. Besides, they all pay no attention to incorporate the spectral information in feature representation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, namely Bilinear Temporal-Spectral Fusion (BTSF). Specifically, we firstly utilize the instance-level augmentation with a simple dropout on the entire time series for maximally capturing long-term dependencies. We devise a novel iterative bilinear temporal-spectral fusion to explicitly encode the affinities of abundant time-frequency pairs, and iteratively refines representations in a fusion-and-squeeze manner with Spectrum-to-Time (S2T) and Time-to-Spectrum (T2S) Aggregation modules. We firstly conducts downstream evaluations on three major tasks for time series including classification, forecasting and anomaly detection. Experimental results shows that our BTSF consistently significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Empirically observed time series in physics, biology, or medicine, are commonly generated by some underlying dynamical system (DS) which is the target of scientific interest. There is an increasing interest to harvest machine learning methods to reconstruct this latent DS in a data-driven, unsupervised way. In many areas of science it is common to sample time series observations from many data modalities simultaneously, e.g. electrophysiological and behavioral time series in a typical neuroscience experiment. However, current machine learning tools for reconstructing DSs usually focus on just one data modality. Here we propose a general framework for multi-modal data integration for the purpose of nonlinear DS reconstruction and the analysis of cross-modal relations. This framework is based on dynamically interpretable recurrent neural networks as general approximators of nonlinear DSs, coupled to sets of modality-specific decoder models from the class of generalized linear models. Both an expectation-maximization and a variational inference algorithm for model training are advanced and compared. We show on nonlinear DS benchmarks that our algorithms can efficiently compensate for too noisy or missing information in one data channel by exploiting other channels, and demonstrate on experimental neuroscience data how the algorithm learns to link different data domains to the underlying dynamics.},

  abstract = {Time series alignment methods call for highly expressive, differentiable and invertible warping functions which preserve temporal topology, i.e diffeomorphisms. Diffeomorphic warping functions can be generated from the integration of velocity fields governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Gradient-based optimization frameworks containing diffeomorphic transformations require to calculate derivatives to the differential equation's solution with respect to the model parameters, i.e. sensitivity analysis. Unfortunately, deep learning frameworks typically lack automatic-differentiation-compatible sensitivity analysis methods; and implicit functions, such as the solution of ODE, require particular care. Current solutions appeal to adjoint sensitivity methods, ad-hoc numerical solvers or ResNet's Eulerian discretization. In this work, we present a closed-form expression for the ODE solution and its gradient under continuous piecewise-affine (CPA) velocity functions. We present a highly optimized implementation of the results on CPU and GPU. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets to validate the generalization ability of our model to unseen data for time-series joint alignment. Results show significant improvements both in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

However, the practical utility of such estimates is limited by how accurately they quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the joint predictive distribution of high-dimensional multivariate time series. We propose a versatile method, based on the transformer architecture, that estimates joint distributions using an attention-based decoder that provably learns to mimic the properties of non-parametric copulas. The resulting model has several desirable properties: it can scale to hundreds of time series, supports both forecasting and interpolation, can handle unaligned and non-uniformly sampled data, and can seamlessly adapt to missing data during training. We demonstrate these properties empirically and show that our model produces state-of-the-art predictions on multiple real-world datasets.},

To address these problems, we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method, in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that most time series tend to have a sparse representation in well-known basis such as Fourier transform, and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being more effective, the proposed method, termed as Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (\{\textbackslash bf FEDformer\}), is more efficient than standard Transformer with a linear complexity to the sequence length. Our empirical studies with six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, FEDformer can reduce prediction error by \$14.8\textbackslash\%\$ and \$22.6\textbackslash\%\$ for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

ChatGPT has gained an immense popularity since its launch, amassing 100 million active monthly users in just two months, thereby establishing itself as the fastest-growing consumer application to date. This paper discusses the reasons for its success as well as the future prospects of similar large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their potential impact on forecasting, a specialized and domain-specific field. This is achieved by first comparing the correctness of the answers of the standard ChatGPT and a custom one, trained using published papers from a subfield of forecasting where the answers to the questions asked are known, allowing us to determine their correctness compared to those of the two ChatGPT versions. Then, we also compare the responses of the two versions on how judgmental adjustments to the statistical/ML forecasts should be applied by firms to improve their accuracy. The paper concludes by considering the future of LLMs and their impact on all aspects of our life and work, as well as on the field of forecasting specifically.

In contrast, this study automatically selects and weights sub-models from a heterogeneous model pool. It solves an optimization problem using an interior-point filtering linear-search algorithm. The objective function innovatively incorporates negative correlation learning as a penalty term, with which a diverse model subset can be selected. The best sub-models from each model class are selected to build the NCL ensemble, which performance is better than the simple average and other state-of-the-art weighting methods. It is also possible to improve the NCL ensemble with a regularization term in the objective function. In practice, it is difficult to conclude the optimal sub-model for a dataset prior due to the model uncertainty. Regardless, our method would achieve comparable accuracy as the potential optimal sub-models. In conclusion, the value of this study lies in its ease of use and effectiveness, allowing the hybrid ensemble to embrace diversity and accuracy.},

Available methods in the literature either follow a projection matrix-based approach or an empirical copula-based reordering approach to revise the incoherent future sample paths to obtain reconciled probabilistic forecasts. The projection matrices are estimated either by optimizing a scoring rule such as energy or variogram score or simply using a projection matrix derived for point forecast reconciliation.This article proves that (a) if the incoherent predictive distribution is jointly Gaussian, then MinT (minimum trace) minimizes the logarithmic scoring rule for the hierarchy; and (b) the logarithmic score of MinT for each marginal predictive density is smaller than that of OLS (ordinary least squares). We illustrate these theoretical results using a set of simulation studies and the Australian domestic tourism dataset. The estimation of MinT needs to estimate the covariance matrix of the base forecast errors. We have evaluated the performance using the sample covariance matrix and shrinkage estimator. It was observed that the theoretical properties noted above are greatly impacted by the covariance matrix used and highlighted the importance of estimating it reliably, especially with high dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Sustained ocean time series are critical for characterizing marine ecosystem shifts in a time of accelerating, and at times unpredictable, changes. They represent the only means to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic forcings, and are the best tools to explore causal links and implications for human communities that depend on ocean resources. Since the inception of sustained ocean observations, ocean time series have withstood many challenges, most prominently availability of uninterrupted funding and retention of trained personnel. This OceanObs’19 review article provides an overarching vision for sustained ocean time series observations for the next decade, focusing on the growing challenges of maintaining sustained ocean time series, including ship-based and autonomous coastal and open-ocean platforms, as well as remote sensing. In addition to increased diversification of funding sources to include the private sector, NGOs, and other groups, more effective engagement of stakeholders and other end-users will be critical to ensure the sustainability of ocean time series programs. Building a cohesive international time series network will require dedicated capacity to coordinate across observing programs and leverage existing infrastructure and platforms of opportunity. This review article outlines near-term observing priorities and technology needs; explores potential mechanisms to broaden ocean time series data applications and end-user communities; and describes current tools and future requirements for managing increasingly complex multi-platform data streams and developing synthesis products that support science and society. The actionable recommendations outlined herein ultimately form the basis for a robust, sustainable, fit-for-purpose time series network that will foster a predictive understanding of changing ocean systems for the benefit of society.},

The scalability of these DFs at more localized scales, such as the province scale, has not been systematically explored. We use a unique Chinese data set to examine the damage at the TC-event scale and province scale. Our results show that the parameters and performance of TC DF are spatially dependent. For a sigmoidal DF, the parameter dependence is manifested by a flatter curve calibrated on the TC-event scale compared to the province scale. In the case of a power-law DF, the dependence of its parameters is evident in the statistically more significant coefficients of the explanatory variables that are aggregated to the TC-event scale, compared to the province scale. Performance comparison results further reveal that the scale dependence of performance is related to the type of DF. Integrating hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, the power-law DF complements the typical sigmoidal DF, producing more accurate estimates of direct economic loss and annual average damage at both the TC-event and province scales. However, its performance, compared to that of the sigmoidal DF, is more influenced by the scale at which it is calibrated. Our findings elucidate scale-related research questions in TC risk assessment, offer insights into the selection of DFs, and inspire the future prospect of using multiple DFs to reduce the functional uncertainty.},

However, a major challenge in attributing and projecting changes in disaster risk is that damage is influenced not only by the physical climate hazard, but also by non-climatic factors that shape exposure and vulnerability. Recent assessments of integrated disaster risk have been hampered by the paucity of literature analyzing local-scale interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability in the historical record. Here we develop an integrated empirical analysis of historical flood damage that emphasizes spatial and temporal heterogeneity in flood hazard, economic exposure and social vulnerability. Using the Midwestern United States as a testbed, we show that annual property damage from flooding is projected to increase by 13 to 17.4~\% over the next two decades. At the state level, over half of the increase is driven by projected growth in housing units. However, at the county level, the dominant factor causing future damage varies, emphasizing the value of a fully integrated, spatially and temporally resolved approach to assessing flooding risk and control strategies.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of the behaviours of the various geophysical processes and an effective evaluation of time series (else referred to as “stochastic”) simulation models require, among others, detailed investigations across temporal scales. In this work, we propose a novel and detailed methodological framework for advancing and enriching such investigations in a hydroclimatic context. This specific framework is primarily based on a new feature compilation for multi-scale hydroclimatic analyses, and can facilitate largely interpretable feature investigations and comparisons in terms of temporal dependence, temporal variation, “forecastability”, lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity (and linearity), trends, spikiness, curvature and seasonality. Multifaceted characterizations are herein obtained by computing the values of the proposed feature compilation across nine temporal resolutions (i.e., the 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 7-day, 0.5-month, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month and 6-month ones) and three hydroclimatic time series types (i.e., temperature, precipitation and streamflow) for 34-year-long time series records originating from 511 geographical locations across the contiguous United States. Based on the acquired information and knowledge, similarities and differences between the examined time series types with respect to the evolution patterns characterizing their feature values with increasing (or decreasing) temporal resolution are identified. Moreover, the computed features are used as inputs to unsupervised random forests for detecting any meaningful clusters between the examined hydroclimatic time series. This clustering plays an illustrative role within this research, as it facilitates the identification of spatial patterns (with them consisting an important scientific target in hydroclimatic research) and their cross-scale comparison. We find that these specific patterns are largely analogous across temporal resolutions for the examined continental-scale region. We also apply explainable machine learning to compare the features with respect to their usefulness in clustering the time series at the various temporal resolutions. These latter investigations play a vital role within the proposed methodological framework, as they allow interpretation of hydroclimatic similarity at the various temporal resolutions. For most of the features, this usefulness can vary to a notable degree across temporal resolutions and time series types, thereby implying the need for conducting multifaceted time series characterizations for the study of hydroclimatic similarity.},

The hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting includes two sub-tasks, i.e., forecasting and reconciliation. In the previous works, hierarchical information is only integrated in the reconciliation step to maintain coherency, but not in forecasting step for accuracy improvement. In this paper, we propose two novel tree-based feature integration mechanisms, i.e., top-down convolution and bottom-up attention to leverage the information of the hierarchical structure to improve the forecasting performance. Moreover, unlike most previous reconciliation methods which either rely on strong assumptions or focus on coherent constraints only, we utilize deep neural optimization networks, which not only achieve coherency without any assumptions, but also allow more flexible and realistic constraints to achieve task-based targets, e.g., lower under-estimation penalty and meaningful decision-making loss to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our tree-based feature integration mechanism achieves superior performances on hierarchical forecasting tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and our neural optimization networks can be applied to real-world tasks effectively without any additional effort under coherence and task-based constraints.},

  abstract = {There are more than 7,000 known rare diseases, but pharmaceutical manufacturers developed treatments for only 500 of them. To improve the availability and accessibility of treatments for rare diseases, governments have introduced several programs including subsidies, exogenous pricing, and outcome-based payment schemes in recent years. What kind of subsidy programs and pricing mechanisms can improve patient access? Inspired by various pilot programs, we present a multistage game theoretic model to analyze different subsidy schemes proposed for rare diseases. In addition to the traditional setting in which the manufacturer sets the price, we consider an “exogenous pricing scheme” under which an independent consortium sets the price. We also examine an outcome-based payment scheme, which offers the drug for free if it is not efficacious. We formulate a four-stage Stackelberg game to determine whether it is optimal to subsidize the pharmaceutical manufacturer, the patients, or both. Our results offer several insights. First, we find that government subsidies are crucial to entice new drug development for rare diseases. Also, we find that the pricing scheme matters: The exogenous pricing scheme can improve patient welfare, but it reduces the manufacturer’s expected profit. We find that this result is robust even when an outcome-based payment scheme is used. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

  abstract = {Decision makers often ask experts to forecast a future state. Experts, however, can be biased. In the economics and psychology literature, one extensively studied behavioral bias is called herding. Under strong levels of herding, disclosure of public information may lower forecasting accuracy. This result, however, is derived only for point forecasts. In this paper, we consider experts’ probabilistic forecasts under herding, find a closed-form expression for the first two moments of a unique equilibrium forecast, and show that the experts report too similar locations and inflate the variance of their forecasts because of herding. Furthermore, we show that the negative externality of public information no longer holds. In addition to reacting to new information as expected, probabilistic forecasts contain more information about the experts’ full beliefs and interpersonal structure. This facilitates model estimation. To this end, we consider a one-shot setting with one forecast per expert and show that our model is identifiable up to an infinite number of solutions based on point forecasts but up to two solutions based on probabilistic forecasts. We then provide a Bayesian estimation procedure for these two solutions and apply it to economic forecasting data collected by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. We find that, on average, the experts invest around 19\% of their efforts into making similar forecasts. The level of herding shows an increasing trend from 1999 to 2007 but drops sharply during the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and then rises again until 2019.

However, what if the advisors say that an event is “likely” or “probable?” In eight studies (n = 7,334), we find that people are more likely to act as if they “count” verbal probabilities (i.e., they move closer to certainty than any individual advisor’s forecast) than they are to “count” numeric probabilities. For example, when the advisors both say an event is “likely,” participants will say that it is “very likely.” This effect occurs for both probabilities above and below 50\%, for hypothetical scenarios and real events, and when presenting the others’ forecasts simultaneously or sequentially. We also show that this combination strategy carries over to subsequent consumer decisions that rely on advisors’ likelihood judgments. We discuss and rule out several candidate mechanisms for our effect. This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, decision analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces formal monitoring procedures as a risk-management tool. Continuously monitoring risk forecasts allows practitioners to swiftly review and update their forecasting procedures as soon as forecasts turn inadequate. Similarly, regulators may take timely action in case reported risk forecasts become poor. Extant (one-shot) backtests require, however, that all data are available prior to testing and are not informative of when inadequacies might have occurred. To monitor value-at-risk and expected shortfall forecasts “online”—that is, as new observations become available—we construct sequential testing procedures. We derive the exact finite-sample distributions of the proposed procedures and discuss the suitability of asymptotic approximations. Simulations demonstrate good behavior of our exact procedures in finite samples. An empirical application to major stock indices during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the economic benefits of our monitoring approach. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract = {We study decision behavior in the selection, forecasting, and production for a new product. In a stylized behavioral model and five experiments, we generate new insight into when and why this combination of tasks can lead to overconfidence (specifically, overestimating the demand). We theorize that cognitive limitations lead to noisy interpretations of signal information, which itself is noisy. Because people are statistically naive, they directly use their noisy interpretation of the signal information as their forecast, thereby underaccounting for the uncertainty that underlies it. This process leads to unbiased forecast errors when considering products in isolation, but leads to positively biased forecasts for the products people choose to launch due to a selection effect. We show that this selection-driven overconfidence can be sufficiently problematic that, under certain conditions, choosing the product randomly can actually yield higher profits than when individuals themselves choose the product to launch. We provide mechanism evidence by manipulating the interpretation noise through information complexity—showing that even when the information is equivalent from a Bayesian perspective, more complicated information leads to more noise, which, in turn, leads to more overconfidence in the chosen products. Finally, we leverage this insight to show that getting a second independent forecast for a chosen product can significantly mitigate the overconfidence problem, even when both individuals have the same information.

Moreover, we perform both a simulated-data and an archival-data analysis to examine how the forecasting performance of quantile regression against OLS changes with the shape of the profitability distribution. Considering the MAFE and mean squared forecast error (MSFE) criteria together, we see that the quantile regression is more accurate relative to OLS when the profitability to be forecast has a heavier-tailed distribution. In addition, the asymmetry of the profitability distribution has either a U-shape or an inverted-U-shape effect on the forecasting accuracy of quantile regression. An application of the distributional shape analysis framework to cash flow forecasting demonstrates the usefulness of the framework beyond profitability forecasting, providing additional empirical evidence on the positive effect of tail-heaviness and supporting the notion of an inverted-U-shape effect of asymmetry.

Drawing on these data, we propose a Bayesian BIN model (Bias, Information, Noise) for disentangling the underlying processes that enable forecasters and forecasting methods to improve—either by tamping down bias and noise in judgment or by ramping up the efficient extraction of valid information from the environment. The BIN model reveals that noise reduction plays a surprisingly consistent role across all three methods of enhancing performance.

  abstract = {We initiate the study of incentive-compatible forecasting competitions in which multiple forecasters make predictions about one or more events and compete for a single prize. We have two objectives: (1) to incentivize forecasters to report truthfully and (2) to award the prize to the most accurate forecaster. Proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting if all forecasters are paid according to their scores. However, incentives become distorted if only the best-scoring forecaster wins a prize, since forecasters can often increase their probability of having the highest score by reporting more extreme beliefs. In this paper, we introduce two novel forecasting competition mechanisms. Our first mechanism is incentive compatible and guaranteed to select the most accurate forecaster with probability higher than any other forecaster. Moreover, we show that in the standard single-event, two-forecaster setting and under mild technical conditions, no other incentive-compatible mechanism selects the most accurate forecaster with higher probability. Our second mechanism is incentive compatible when forecasters’ beliefs are such that information about one event does not lead to belief updates on other events, and it selects the best forecaster with probability approaching one as the number of events grows. Our notion of incentive compatibility is more general than previous definitions of dominant strategy incentive compatibility in that it allows for reports to be correlated with the event outcomes. Moreover, our mechanisms are easy to implement and can be generalized to the related problems of outputting a ranking over forecasters and hiring a forecaster with high accuracy on future events.

A brief overview of the field is given here, allowing the reader to recognize the terminology, the various subfields, and components of machine learning, as well as the clinical potential. Radiomics, an expansion of computer-aided diagnosis, has been defined as the conversion of images to minable data. The ultimate benefit of quantitative radiomics is to (1) yield predictive image-based phenotypes of disease for precision medicine or (2) yield quantitative image-based phenotypes for data mining with other -omics for discovery (ie, imaging genomics). For deep learning in radiology to succeed, note that well-annotated large data sets are needed since deep networks are complex, computer software and hardware are evolving constantly, and subtle differences in disease states are more difficult to perceive than differences in everyday objects. In the future, machine learning in radiology is expected to have a substantial clinical impact with imaging examinations being routinely obtained in clinical practice, providing an opportunity to improve decision support in medical image interpretation. The term of note is decision support, indicating that computers will augment human decision making, making it more effective and efficient. The clinical impact of having computers in the routine clinical practice may allow radiologists to further integrate their knowledge with their clinical colleagues in other medical specialties and allow for precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Inference for prediction errors is critical in time series forecasting pipelines. However, providing statistically meaningful uncertainty intervals for prediction errors remains relatively under-explored. Practitioners often resort to forward cross-validation (FCV) for obtaining point estimators and constructing confidence intervals based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The naive version assumes independence, a condition that is usually invalid due to time correlation. These approaches lack statistical interpretations and theoretical justifications even under stationarity. This paper systematically investigates uncertainty intervals for prediction errors in time series forecasting. We first distinguish two key inferential targets: the stochastic test error over near future data points, and the expected test error as the expectation of the former. The stochastic test error is often more relevant in applications needing to quantify uncertainty over individual time series instances. To construct prediction intervals for the stochastic test error, we propose the quantile-based forward cross-validation (QFCV) method. Under an ergodicity assumption, QFCV intervals have asymptotically valid coverage and are shorter than marginal empirical quantiles. In addition, we also illustrate why naive CLT-based FCV intervals fail to provide valid uncertainty intervals, even with certain corrections. For non-stationary time series, we further provide rolling intervals by combining QFCV with adaptive conformal prediction to give time-average coverage guarantees. Overall, we advocate the use of QFCV procedures and demonstrate their coverage and efficiency through simulations and real data examples.},

Expert pooling weights from the local prediction pool approaches the equal weight solution whenever there is little data on local predictive performance, making the pools robust and adaptive.

We propose the use of a specification which avoids the use of this lower triangular parameterization. We show that the presence of multivariate stochastic volatility allows for identification of the proposed model and prove that it is invariant to ordering. We develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm which allows for Bayesian estimation and prediction. In exercises involving artificial and real macroeconomic data, we demonstrate that the choice of variable ordering can have non-negligible effects on empirical results when using the non-order invariant approach. In a macroeconomic forecasting exercise involving VARs with 20 variables we find that our order-invariant approach leads to the best forecasts and that some choices of variable ordering can lead to poor forecasts using a conventional, non-order invariant, approach.},

  abstract = {We investigate Bayesian inventory control problems where parameters of the demand distribution are not known a priori but need to be learned using right-censored sales data. A Bayesian framework is adopted for demand learning, and the corresponding control problem is analyzed via Bayesian dynamic programming (BDP). In the Bayesian setting, it is known that the BDP-optimal decision is equal to the sum of the myopic-optimal decision plus a nonnegative “exploration boost.” The goal of this paper is to (i) identify those applications in which adding an exploration boost is important and (ii) characterize the form of the exploration boost. In contrast to recent research that suggests that ignoring the exploration boost (i.e., adopting the myopic policy) can perform reasonably well in certain settings, we show that for applications with moderate time horizons and high parameter uncertainty, the optimality gap between the myopic policy and the BDP-optimal policy can be arbitrarily large and in particular, grows in proportion to the posterior index of dispersion of the unknown mean demand. With regard to characterizing the form of the BDP-optimal exploration boost, we prove that the exploration boost is also proportional to the posterior index of dispersion of the unknown mean demand. This characterization expresses in clear terms the way in which the statistical learning and inventory control are jointly optimized; when there is a high degree of parameter uncertainty (encoded as a large posterior index of dispersion), inventory decisions are boosted to induce a higher chance of observing more sales data so as to more quickly resolve statistical uncertainty (i.e., accelerated demand learning), and to not do so will necessarily lead to poor performance.

  abstract = {Background In order to capture the differences in burden between the subtypes of depression, the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study for the first time estimated the burden of dysthymia and major depressive disorder separately from the previously used umbrella term ‘unipolar depression’. A global summary of epidemiological parameters are necessary inputs in burden of disease calculations for 21 world regions, males and females and for the year 1990, 2005 and 2010. This paper reports findings from a systematic review of global epidemiological data and the subsequent development of an internally consistent epidemiological model of dysthymia. Methods A systematic search was conducted to identify data sources for the prevalence, incidence, remission and excess-mortality of dysthymia using Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE electronic databases and grey literature. DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used to check the epidemiological parameters for internal consistency and to predict estimates for world regions with no or few data. Results The systematic review identified 38 studies meeting inclusion criteria which provided 147 data points for 30 countries in 13 of 21 world regions. Prevalence increases in the early ages, peaking at around 50 years. Females have higher prevalence of dysthymia than males. Global pooled prevalence remained constant across time points at 1.55\% (95\%CI 1.50–1.60). There was very little regional variation in prevalence estimates. Limitations There were eight GBD world regions for which we found no data for which DisMod-MR had to impute estimates. Conclusion The addition of internally consistent epidemiological estimates by world region, age, sex and year for dysthymia contributed to a more comprehensive estimate of mental health burden in GBD 2010.},

  abstract = {Algorithms such as Differentially Private SGD enable training machine learning models with formal privacy guarantees. However, because these guarantees hold with respect to unrealistic adversaries, the protection afforded against practical attacks is typically much better. An emerging strand of work empirically estimates the protection afforded by differentially private training as a confidence interval for the privacy budget \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash varepsilon\}\$ spent with respect to specific threat models. Existing approaches derive confidence intervals for \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash varepsilon\}\$ from confidence intervals for false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks, which requires training an impractically large number of models to get intervals that can be acted upon. We propose a novel, more efficient Bayesian approach that brings privacy estimates within the reach of practitioners. Our approach reduces sample size by computing a posterior for \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash varepsilon\}\$ (not just a confidence interval) from the joint posterior of the false positive and false negative rates of membership inference attacks. We implement an end-to-end system for privacy estimation that integrates our approach and state-of-the-art membership inference attacks, and evaluate it on text and vision classification tasks. For the same number of samples, we see a reduction in interval width of up to 40\% compared to prior work.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.},

Yet this feature is rarely taken advantage of, and violates common assumptions made by many neural network layers, such as translation equivariance. Further, many works that do incorporate locality fail to capture fine-grained structure. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer, a sparsely-gated layer that learns spatial structure in the input domain and routes experts at a fine-grained level to utilize it. We also develop new techniques to train SMoEs, including a self-supervised routing loss and damping expert errors. Finally, we show strong results for SMoEs on numerous tasks, and set new state-of-the-art results for medium-range weather prediction and post-processing ensemble weather forecasts.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that deep learning models such as RNNs and Transformers have brought significant performance gains for long-term forecasting of time series because they effectively utilize historical information. We found, however, that there is still great room for improvement in how to preserve historical information in neural networks while avoiding overfitting to noise present in the history. Addressing this allows better utilization of the capabilities of deep learning models. To this end, we design a Frequency improved Legendre Memory model, or FiLM: it applies Legendre polynomial projections to approximate historical information, uses Fourier projection to remove noise, and adds a low-rank approximation to speed up computation. Our empirical studies show that the proposed FiLM significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting by (19.2\%, 22.6\%), respectively. We also demonstrate that the representation module developed in this work can be used as a general plugin to improve the long-term prediction performance of other deep learning modules.

This assumption can be restrictive in the business world as decision makers often face an evolving environment in which the mean rewards are time-varying. In this paper, we consider a nonstationary MAB model with K arms whose mean rewards vary over time in a periodic manner. The unknown periods can be different across arms and scale with the length of the horizon T polynomially. We propose a two-stage policy that combines the Fourier analysis with a confidence bound–based learning procedure to learn the periods and minimize the regret. In stage one, the policy correctly estimates the periods of all arms with high probability. In stage two, the policy explores the periodic mean rewards of arms using the periods estimated in stage one and exploits the optimal arm in the long run. We show that our learning policy incurs a regret upper bound.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for forecasting multivariate data that follow known linear constraints. This is particularly common in forecasting where some variables are aggregates of others, commonly referred to as hierarchical time series, but also arises in other prediction settings. For point forecasting, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby forecasts are made for all series (so-called base forecasts) and subsequently adjusted to cohere with the constraints. We extend reconciliation from point forecasting to probabilistic forecasting. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic forecast. In the elliptical case, we prove that true predictive distributions can be recovered using reconciliation even when the location and scale of base predictions are chosen arbitrarily. Reconciliation weights are estimated to optimise energy or variogram score. The log score is not considered since it is improper when comparing unreconciled to reconciled forecasts, a result also proved in this paper. Due to randomness in the objective function, optimisation uses stochastic gradient descent. This method improves upon base forecasts in simulated and empirical data, particularly when the base forecasting models are severely misspecified. For milder misspecification, extending popular reconciliation methods for point forecasting results in similar performance to score optimisation.},

We do this within an encoder-decoder sequence learning framework that integrates the following data: 1) offline geographical and social attributes. For example, the geographical structure of roads or public social events such as national celebrations; 2) road intersection information. In general, traffic congestion occurs at major junctions; 3) online crowd queries. For example, when many online queries issued for the same destination due to a public performance, the traffic around the destination will potentially become heavier at this location after a while. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on a real-world dataset from Baidu have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract = {In order to apply Neural Networks in safety-critical settings, such as healthcare or autonomous driving, we need to be able to analyse their robustness against adversarial attacks. As complete verification is often computationally prohibitive, we rely on cheap and effective adversarial attacks to estimate their robustness. However, state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, such as the frequently used PGD attack, often require many random restarts to generate adversarial examples. Each time we perform a restart we ignore all previous unsuccessful runs. In order to alleviate this inefficiency, we propose a method that learns from its mistakes. Specifically, our method uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an attention mechanism, to greatly reduce the search space for the attacks. The architecture of the GNN is based on the neural network we are attacking, and we perform forward and backward passes though the GNN mimicking the back-propagation algorithm of PGD attacks. The GNN outputs a smaller subspace for the PGD attack to focus on. Using our method, we manage to boost the attacks' performance: the GNN increases the success rate of PGD by over 35\textbackslash\% on a recent published dataset used for comparing adversarial attacks, while simultaneously reducing its average computation time.},

  abstract = {The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is an appealing tool in survival analysis because of its ease of interpretation, but when there is a large volume of data, fitting an AFT model and carrying out the associated inference on one computer can be computationally demanding. This poses a severe limitation for the application of the AFT model in the face of big data. The article addresses this problem by developing a simple distributed method for estimating the parameters of an AFT model based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, which has the dual benefits of statistical efficiency and computational economy. It is an iterative method that involves, for the most part, some rather simple algebraic operations, except for obtaining the initial estimate, which is based on a smoothed approximation of the Gehan estimating equation. Our results show that the proposed method yields estimates that converge after a few iterations and an estimator that is asymptotically as efficient as the benchmark estimator obtained by using the full data in one go. We also develop an associated inference procedure. The merits of the proposed method are demonstrated via an extensive simulation study. The method is applied to a kidney transplantation dataset.

We aimed to extensively update estimates of global vision loss burden, presenting estimates for 2020, temporal change over three decades between 1990-2020, and forecasts for 2050. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye disease from January, 1980, to October, 2018. Only studies with samples representative of the population and with clearly defined visual acuity testing protocols were included. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate 2020 prevalence (with 95\% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) of mild vision impairment (presenting visual acuity ≥6/18 and {$<$}6/12), moderate and severe vision impairment ({$<$}6/18 to 3/60), and blindness ({$<$}3/60 or less than 10° visual field around central fixation); and vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia (presenting near vision},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. METHODS: GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. FINDINGS: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. INTERPRETATION: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

  abstract = {Meta-analysis methods are used to combine evidence from multiple studies. Meta-regression as well as model-based meta-analysis are extensions of standard pairwise meta-analysis in which information about study-level covariates and (arm-level) dosing amount or exposure may be taken into account. A Bayesian approach to inference is very attractive in this context, especially when a meta-analysis is based on few studies only or rare events. In this article, we present the R package MetaStan which implements a wide range of pairwise and model-based meta-analysis models. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework is used to describe the pairwise meta-analysis, meta-regression and model-based meta-analysis models. Within the GLMM framework, the likelihood and link functions are adapted to reflect the nature of the data. For example, a binomial likelihood with a logit link is used to perform a meta-analysis based on datasets with dichotomous endpoints. Bayesian computations are conducted using Stan via the rstan interface. Stan uses a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler which belongs to the family of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Stan implementations are done by using suitable parametrizations to ease computations. The user-friendly R package MetaStan, available on CRAN, supports a wide range of pairwise and model-based meta-analysis models. MetaStan provides fitting functions for pairwise meta-analysis with the option of including covariates and model-based meta-analysis. The supported outcome types are continuous, binary, and count. Forest plots for the pairwise meta-analysis and dose-response plots for the model-based meta-analysis can be obtained from the package. The use of MetaStan is demonstrated through clinical examples.},

  abstract = {Background Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease. Methods GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30\hphantom{,}652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden. Findings The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2\% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4\% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6\% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years and 75 years and older. Interpretation Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

Yet, there is currently neither a formal framework nor a practical method for the probabilistic reconciliation of count time series. This paper proposes a definition of coherency and reconciled probabilistic forecast, which applies to real-valued and count variables, and a novel method for probabilistic reconciliation. It is based on a generalization of Bayes’ rule and can reconcile real-value and count variables. When applied to count variables, it yields a reconciled probability mass function. Our experiments with the temporal reconciliation of count variables show a major forecast improvement compared to the probabilistic Gaussian reconciliation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. METHODS: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68\hphantom{,}781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. FINDINGS: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2\% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9\% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5\% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782-3252] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in males vs s1400 [1279-1524] per 100\hphantom{,}000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). INTERPRETATION: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

  abstract = {Epidemiology as an empirical science has developed sophisticated methods to measure the causes and patterns of disease in populations. Nevertheless, for many diseases in many countries only partial data are available. When the partial data are insufficient, but data collection is not an option, it is possible to supplement the data by exploiting the causal relations between the various variables that describe a disease process. We present a simple generic disease model with incidence, one prevalent state, and case fatality and remission. We derive a set of equations that describes this disease process and allows calculation of the complete epidemiology of a disease given a minimum of three input variables. We give the example of asthma with age-specific prevalence, remission, and mortality as inputs. Outputs are incidence and case fatality, among others. The set of equations is embedded in a software package called 'DisMod II', which is made available to the public domain by the World Health Organization.},

To overcome this problem, we propose a matrix-based privacy method called k-nearest time series + (k-nTS+) swapping that preserves time series features to maintain forecast accuracy. We apply our privacy method to a forecasting competition data set and find that k-nTS+ swapping maintains forecast accuracy and preserves the distribution of time series features much better than competitor methods at similar privacy levels. The k-nTS+ protected time series are also more representative of the original data, potentially leading to increased trust between data owners and forecasters. Using our approach, data owners can share representative time series data with useful features and significantly reduced privacy concerns. This can increase data availability to the forecasting community and give privacy-conscious data owners a competitive advantage.},

Traditionally the problem has been dealt with modifications in the conventional parametric methods such as Croston. However, these methods are generally applied at the observed frequency, ignoring any additional information, such as trend that becomes prominent at higher levels of aggregation. We evaluate established Temporal Aggregation (TA) methods: ADIDA, Forecast Combination, and Temporal Hierarchies in the said context. We further employ restricted least-squares estimation and propose two new combination approaches tailored to decreasing demand scenarios. Finally, we test our propositions on both simulated and real datasets. Our empirical findings support the use of variable forecast combination weights to improve TA’s performance in intermittent demand items with a risk of obsolescence.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the growing field of Bayesian prediction. Bayes point and interval prediction are defined and exemplified and situated in statistical prediction more generally. Then, four general approaches to Bayes prediction are defined and we turn to predictor selection. This can be done predictively or non-predictively and predictors can be based on single models or multiple models. We call these latter cases unitary predictors and model average predictors, respectively. Then we turn to the most recent aspect of prediction to emerge, namely prediction in the context of large observational data sets and discuss three further classes of techniques. We conclude with a summary and statement of several current open problems.},

  abstract = {Data-driven methods that detect anomalies in times series data are ubiquitous in practice, but they are in general unable to provide helpful explanations for the predictions they make. In this work we propose a model-agnostic algorithm that generates counterfactual ensemble explanations for time series anomaly detection models. Our method generates a set of diverse counterfactual examples, i.e, multiple perturbed versions of the original time series that are not considered anomalous by the detection model. Since the magnitude of the perturbations is limited, these counterfactuals represent an ensemble of inputs similar to the original time series that the model would deem normal. Our algorithm is applicable to any differentiable anomaly detection model. We investigate the value of our method on univariate and multivariate real-world datasets and two deep-learning-based anomaly detection models, under several explainability criteria previously proposed in other data domains such as Validity, Plausibility, Closeness and Diversity. We show that our algorithm can produce ensembles of counterfactual examples that satisfy these criteria and thanks to a novel type of visualisation, can convey a richer interpretation of a model's internal mechanism than existing methods. Moreover, we design a sparse variant of our method to improve the interpretability of counterfactual explanations for high-dimensional time series anomalies. In this setting, our explanation is localised on only a few dimensions and can therefore be communicated more efficiently to the model's user.},

However, the parameters of LSTM have greatly influenced its accuracy and performance. In this study, LSTM with fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), called FOA-LSTM, is designed to solve time series problems. As a novel intelligent algorithm, FOA is applied to decide on the optimal hyper-parameter of LSTM. Experiments under the NN3 time series, three comparative experiments and the monthly energy consumption of the USA are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the FOA-LSTM model. The results indicate that the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) is reduced by up to 11.44\% in the last 11 monthly series in the NN3 dataset. Four comparative experiments and the real-life series verify further that the FOA-LSTM model obtains a better result compared with other forecasting models.},

  abstract = {Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38\% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.

  abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39\,years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

They capture dynamic system measurements and are produced in vast quantities by both physical and virtual sensors. Analyzing these data types is vital to harnessing the rich information they encompass and thus benefits a wide range of downstream tasks. Recent advances in large language and other foundational models have spurred increased use of these models in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Such methodologies not only enable enhanced pattern recognition and reasoning across diverse domains but also lay the groundwork for artificial general intelligence capable of comprehending and processing common temporal data. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive and up-to-date review of large models tailored (or adapted) for time series and spatio-temporal data, spanning four key facets: data types, model categories, model scopes, and application areas/tasks. Our objective is to equip practitioners with the knowledge to develop applications and further research in this underexplored domain. We primarily categorize the existing literature into two major clusters: large models for time series analysis (LM4TS) and spatio-temporal data mining (LM4STD). On this basis, we further classify research based on model scopes (i.e., general vs. domain-specific) and application areas/tasks. We also provide a comprehensive collection of pertinent resources, including datasets, model assets, and useful tools, categorized by mainstream applications. This survey coalesces the latest strides in large model-centric research on time series and spatio-temporal data, underscoring the solid foundations, current advances, practical applications, abundant resources, and future research opportunities.},

Based on a modified sample of an instrumental Markov chain targeting an instrumental distribution (typically via a MCMC kernel), the Importance Markov chain produces an extended Markov chain where the marginal distribution of the first component converges to the target distribution. For example, when targeting a multimodal distribution, the instrumental distribution can be chosen as a tempered version of the target which allows the algorithm to explore its modes more efficiently. We obtain a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem as well as geometric ergodicity for this extended kernel under mild assumptions on the instrumental kernel. Computationally, the algorithm is easy to implement and preexisting librairies can be used to sample from the instrumental distribution.},

However, existing synthetic datasets cannot properly evaluate or predict the algorithms' performance on real data. This study introduces the CausalTime pipeline to generate time-series that highly resemble the real data and with ground truth causal graphs for quantitative performance evaluation. The pipeline starts from real observations in a specific scenario and produces a matching benchmark dataset. Firstly, we harness deep neural networks along with normalizing flow to accurately capture realistic dynamics. Secondly, we extract hypothesized causal graphs by performing importance analysis on the neural network or leveraging prior knowledge. Thirdly, we derive the ground truth causal graphs by splitting the causal model into causal term, residual term, and noise term. Lastly, using the fitted network and the derived causal graph, we generate corresponding versatile time-series proper for algorithm assessment. In the experiments, we validate the fidelity of the generated data through qualitative and quantitative experiments, followed by a benchmarking of existing TSCD algorithms using these generated datasets. CausalTime offers a feasible solution to evaluating TSCD algorithms in real applications and can be generalized to a wide range of fields. For easy use of the proposed approach, we also provide a user-friendly website, hosted on www.causaltime.cc.},

This procedure can be an efficient and effective means of analyzing large datasets. However, VB estimation is often criticised, typically on empirical grounds, for being unable to produce valid statistical inferences. In this article we refute this criticism for one of the simplest models where Bayesian inference is not analytically tractable, that is, the Bayesian linear model (for a particular choice of priors). We prove that under mild regularity conditions, VB based estimators enjoy some desirable frequentist properties such as consistency and can be used to obtain asymptotically valid standard errors. In addition to these results we introduce two VB information criteria: the variational Akaike information criterion and the variational Bayesian information criterion. We show that variational Akaike information criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the frequentist Akaike information criterion and that the variational Bayesian information criterion is first order equivalent to the Bayesian information criterion in linear regression. These results motivate the potential use of the variational information criteria for more complex models. We support our theoretical results with numerical examples.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Our approach is validated with a dataset of 4,523 products of a leading Belgian retailer containing various explanatory variables (e.g., promotions and national events). Using Shapley values and slightly adjusted tree-based methods, we show that superior performance depends on the availability of explanatory variables and additional feature engineering. For robustness, we show that our findings also hold when using the M5 competition dataset. Extensive numerical experimentation finally shows how the forecast superiority of our proposed framework translates to higher service levels, lower inventory costs, and improvements in the bullwhip of orders and inventory.

  abstract = {Probabilistic hierarchical time-series forecasting is an important variant of time-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate time-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on point predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts distributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution which does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works also silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given hierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show deviation from this assumption. We close both these gap and propose PROFHiT, which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHiT uses a flexible probabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency regularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast distribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to datasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHiT over wide range of datasets, we observed 41-88\% better performance in accuracy and significantly better calibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full distribution, we observed that PROFHiT can robustly provide reliable forecasts even if up to 10\% of input time-series data is missing where other methods' performance severely degrade by over 70\%.},

  abstract = {Modeling multi-variate time-series (MVTS) data is a long-standing research subject and has found wide applications. Recently, there is a surge of interest in modeling spatial relations between variables as graphs, i.e., first learning one static graph for each dataset and then exploiting the graph structure via graph neural networks. However, as spatial relations may differ substantially across samples, building one static graph for all the samples inherently limits flexibility and severely degrades the performance in practice. To address this issue, we propose a framework for fine-grained modeling and utilization of spatial correlation between variables. By analyzing the statistical properties of real-world datasets, a universal decomposition of spatial correlation graphs is first identified. Specifically, the hidden spatial relations can be decomposed into a prior part, which applies across all the samples, and a dynamic part, which varies between samples, and building different graphs is necessary to model these relations. To better coordinate the learning of the two relational graphs, we propose a min-max learning paradigm that not only regulates the common part of different dynamic graphs but also guarantees spatial distinguishability among samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on both time-series forecasting and time-series point prediction tasks.},

  abstract = {Existing results on the properties and performance of forecast combinations have been derived in the context of mean squared error loss. Under this loss function empirical studies have generally found that equally-weighted combined forecasts lead to better performance than estimates of optimal forecast combination weights which in turn outperform the best individual predictions. We show that this and other results can be overturned when asymmetries are introduced in the loss function and the forecast error distribution is skewed. We characterize the optimal combination weights for the most commonly used alternatives to mean squared error loss and demonstrate how the degree of asymmetry in the loss function and skews in the underlying forecast error distribution can significantly change the optimal combination weights. We also propose estimation methods and investigate their small sample properties in simulations and in an inflation forecasting exercise.},

Inspired by these concerns, we develop a model for inflation forecasting that is nonparametric both in the conditional mean and in the error using Gaussian and Dirichlet processes, respectively. We discuss how both these features may be important in producing accurate forecasts of inflation. In a forecasting exercise involving CPI inflation, we find that our approach has substantial benefits, both overall and in the left tail, with nonparametric modeling of the conditional mean being of particular importance.},

Its use and importance have exploded over the last 25 years as the need for a robust evidence base has become clear in many scientific areas, including medicine and health, social sciences, education, psychology, ecology, and economics.Recent years have seen an explosion of methods for handling complexities in meta-analysis, including explained and unexplained heterogeneity between studies, publication bias, and sparse data. At the same time, meta-analysis has been extended beyond simple two-group comparisons of continuous and binary outcomes to comparing and ranking the outcomes from multiple groups, to complex observational studies, to assessing heterogeneity of effects, and to survival and multivariate outcomes. Many of these methods are statistically complex and are tailored to specific types of data.Key featuresRigorous coverage of the full range of current statistical methodology used in meta-analysisComprehensive, coherent, and unified overview of the statistical foundations behind meta-analysisDetailed description of the primary methods for both univariate and multivariate dataComputer code to reproduce examples in chaptersThorough review of the literature with thousands of referencesApplications to specific types of biomedical and social science dataSupplementary website with code, data, sample chapters, and errataThis book is for a broad audience of graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the theory and application of statistical methods for meta-analysis.

  abstract = {Background Although meningitis is largely preventable, it still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths globally each year. WHO set ambitious goals to reduce meningitis cases by 2030, and assessing trends in the global meningitis burden can help track progress and identify gaps in achieving these goals. Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we aimed to assess incident cases and deaths due to acute infectious meningitis by aetiology and age from 1990 to 2019, for 204 countries and territories. Methods We modelled meningitis mortality using vital registration, verbal autopsy, sample-based vital registration, and mortality surveillance data. Meningitis morbidity was modelled with a Bayesian compartmental model, using data from the published literature identified by a systematic review, as well as surveillance data, inpatient hospital admissions, health insurance claims, and cause-specific meningitis mortality estimates. For aetiology estimation, data from multiple causes of death, vital registration, hospital discharge, microbial laboratory, and literature studies were analysed by use of a network analysis model to estimate the proportion of meningitis deaths and cases attributable to the following aetiologies: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, viruses, and a residual other pathogen category. Findings In 2019, there were an estimated 236\hphantom{,}000 deaths (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 204\hphantom{,}000–277\hphantom{,}000) and 2·51 million (2·11–2·99) incident cases due to meningitis globally. The burden was greatest in children younger than 5 years, with 112\hphantom{,}000 deaths (87\hphantom{,}400–145\hphantom{,}000) and 1·28 million incident cases (0·947–1·71) in 2019. Age-standardised mortality rates decreased from 7·5 (6·6–8·4) per 100\hphantom{,}000 population in 1990 to 3·3 (2·8–3·9) per 100\hphantom{,}000 population in 2019. The highest proportion of total all-age meningitis deaths in 2019 was attributable to S pneumoniae (18·1\% [17·1–19·2]), followed by N meningitidis (13·6\% [12·7–14·4]) and K pneumoniae (12·2\% [10·2–14·3]). Between 1990 and 2019, H influenzae showed the largest reduction in the number of deaths among children younger than 5 years (76·5\% [69·5–81·8]), followed by N meningitidis (72·3\% [64·4–78·5]) and viruses (58·2\% [47·1–67·3]). Interpretation Substantial progress has been made in reducing meningitis mortality over the past three decades. However, more meningitis-related deaths might be prevented by quickly scaling up immunisation and expanding access to health services. Further reduction in the global meningitis burden should be possible through low-cost multivalent vaccines, increased access to accurate and rapid diagnostic assays, enhanced surveillance, and early treatment.

  abstract = {Non-suicidal self-injury behavior (NSSI) is a serious public health concern that requires immediate attention. Despite the high prevalence of NSSI among the Chinese population, there is a significant gap in research on the comprehensive picture of this field. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to investigate the prevalence, methods, risk factors, and preventive intervention programs related to NSSI in China. The review found that the estimated lifetime prevalence of NSSI among Chinese youth population is alarmingly high at 24.7\% (N~=~1,088,433). Common methods of NSSI include scratching, hitting, and biting. Additionally, the review synthesized 249 risk factors based on the biopsychosocial-ecological framework, highlighting the urgent need for intervention. However, only 12 empirical studies focus on NSSI prevention or intervention programs were included. These findings underscore the necessity for more clinical practices and larger studies to identify effective interventions and ultimately alleviate the burden of NSSI on the Chinese population.

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of energy price is critical to the energy market orientation, and it can provide a reference for policymakers and market participants. In practice, energy prices are affected by external factors, and their accurate prediction is challenging. This paper provides a systematic decade review of data-driven models for energy price prediction. Energy prices include four types: natural gas, crude oil, electricity, and carbon. Through the screening, 171 publications are reviewed in detail from the aspects of the basic model, the data cleaning method, and optimizer. Publishing time, model structure, prediction accuracy, prediction horizon, and input variables for energy price prediction are discussed. The main contributions and findings of this paper are as follows: (1) basic prediction models for energy price, data cleaning methods, and optimizers are classified and described; (2) the structure of the prediction model is finely classified, and it is inferred that the hybrid model and prediction architecture with multiple techniques are the focus of research and the development direction in the future; (3) root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error are the three most frequently used error indicators, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error is less than 0.2; (4) the ranges of data size and data division ratio for energy price prediction in different horizons are given, the proportion of the test set is usually in the range of 0.05–0.35; (5) the input variables for energy price prediction are summarized; (6) the data cleaning method has a more significant role in improving the accuracy of energy price prediction than the optimizer.},

  abstract = {This article studies inference for the average treatment effect in randomized controlled trials with covariate-adaptive randomization. Here, by covariate-adaptive randomization, we mean randomization schemes that first stratify according to baseline covariates and then assign treatment status so as to achieve “balance” within each stratum. Our main requirement is that the randomization scheme assigns treatment status within each stratum so that the fraction of units being assigned to treatment within each stratum has a well behaved distribution centered around a proportion π as the sample size tends to infinity. Such schemes include, for example, Efron’s biased-coin design and stratified block randomization. When testing the null hypothesis that the average treatment effect equals a prespecified value in such settings, we first show the usual two-sample t-test is conservative in the sense that it has limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis no greater than and typically strictly less than the nominal level. We show, however, that a simple adjustment to the usual standard error of the two-sample t-test leads to a test that is exact in the sense that its limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis equals the nominal level. Next, we consider the usual t-test (on the coefficient on treatment assignment) in a linear regression of outcomes on treatment assignment and indicators for each of the strata. We show that this test is exact for the important special case of randomization schemes with π=12, but is otherwise conservative. We again provide a simple adjustment to the standard errors that yields an exact test more generally. Finally, we study the behavior of a modified version of a permutation test, which we refer to as the covariate-adaptive permutation test, that only permutes treatment status for units within the same stratum. When applied to the usual two-sample t-statistic, we show that this test is exact for randomization schemes with π=12 and that additionally achieve what we refer to as “strong balance.” For randomization schemes with π≠12, this test may have limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis strictly greater than the nominal level. When applied to a suitably adjusted version of the two-sample t-statistic, however, we show that this test is exact for all randomization schemes that achieve “strong balance,” including those with π≠12. A simulation study confirms the practical relevance of our theoretical results. We conclude with recommendations for empirical practice and an empirical illustration.

Compared with existing parametric methods such as the multiplicative interaction model and traditional semi-/non-parametric estimation, causal forests are more flexible for complex data generating processes. Specifically, causal forests allow for nonparametric estimation and inference on heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of many moderators. To reveal its usefulness, we revisit existing studies in political science and economics. We uncover new information hidden by original estimation strategies while producing findings that are consistent with conventional methods. Through these replication efforts, we provide a step-by-step practice guide for applying causal forests in evaluating treatment effect heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate probabilistic forecasts while respecting hierarchical information is an important operational challenge in many applications, perhaps most obviously in energy management, supply chain planning, and resource allocation. The basic challenge, especially for multivariate forecasting, is that forecasts are often required to be coherent with respect to the hierarchical structure. In this paper, we propose a new model which leverages a factor model structure to produce coherent forecasts by construction. This is a consequence of a simple (exchangeability) observation: permuting \textbackslash textit\{\}base-level series in the hierarchy does not change their aggregates. Our model uses a convolutional neural network to produce parameters for the factors, their loadings and base-level distributions; it produces samples which can be differentiated with respect to the model's parameters; and it can therefore optimize for any sample-based loss function, including the Continuous Ranked Probability Score and quantile losses. We can choose arbitrary continuous distributions for the factor and the base-level distributions. We compare our method to two previous methods which can be optimized end-to-end, while enforcing coherent aggregation. Our model achieves significant improvements: between \$11.8-41.4\textbackslash\%\$ on three hierarchical forecasting datasets. We also analyze the influence of parameters in our model with respect to base-level distribution and number of factors.},

In infrastructure monitoring, for instance, a database system should be able to process large amounts of sensor data in real-time, execute continuous queries, and handle complex analytical queries such as anomaly detection or forecasting. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate and understand how existing systems and design choices handle specific use cases and workloads. Unfortunately, none of them fully covers the peculiar requirements of monitoring applications. Furthermore, they fall short of providing an automated way to generate representative real-world data and workloads for testing and evaluating these systems. We present TSM-Bench, a benchmark tailored for time series database systems used in monitoring applications. Our key contributions consist of (1) representative queries that meet the requirements that we collected from a water monitoring use case, and (2) a new scalable data generator method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). We demonstrate, through an extensive set of experiments, how TSM-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of seven leading time series database systems while offering a detailed characterization of their capabilities and trade-offs.}

  abstract = {Data Augmentation (DA) has emerged as an indispensable strategy in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily due to its capacity to amplify training samples, thereby bolstering model robustness, diversifying datasets, and curtailing overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented tools. In light of these challenges, this study embarks on an exhaustive dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five principal echelons: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. Our taxonomy promises to serve as a robust navigational aid for scholars, offering clarity and direction in method selection. Addressing the conspicuous absence of holistic evaluations for prevalent DA techniques, we executed an all-encompassing empirical assessment, wherein upwards of 15 DA strategies were subjected to scrutiny across 8 UCR time-series datasets, employing ResNet and a multi-faceted evaluation paradigm encompassing Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, yielding a benchmark accuracy of 88.94 +- 11.83\%.

This generalizes dynamic prediction pools to the nonparametric setting. Efficient posterior simulation based on MCMC methods is also examined. Detailed applications to short-term interest rates, realized covariance matrices and asset pricing models demonstrate that the nonparametric pool forecasts well.

In this work, we focus on the variable selection aspect of penalized quantile regression. Under some mild conditions, we demonstrate the oracle properties of the SCAD and adaptive-LASSO penalized quantile regressions. For the SCAD penalty, despite its good asymptotic properties, the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex and, as a result, much harder to solve. In this work, we take advantage of the decomposition of the SCAD penalty function as the difference of two convex functions and propose to solve the corresponding optimization using the Difference Convex Algorithm (DCA).},

Traditional state-estimation techniques rely on strong assumptions about the form of uncertainty in mathematical models, typically that it manifests as an additive stochastic perturbation or is parametric in nature3. Here we present a reparametrization trick for stochastic variational inference with Markov Gaussian processes that enables an approximate Bayesian approach for state estimation in which the equations governing how the system evolves over time are partially or completely unknown. In contrast to classical state-estimation techniques, our method learns the missing terms in the mathematical model and a state estimate simultaneously from an approximate Bayesian perspective. This development enables the application of state-estimation methods to problems that have so far proved~to be beyond reach. Finally, although we focus on state estimation, the advancements to stochastic variational inference made here are applicable to a broader class of problems in machine learning.},

  abstract = {The highly prized ability to make financial plans with some certainty about the future comes from the core fields of economics. In recent years the availability of more data, analytical tools of greater precision, and ex post studies of business decisions have increased demand for information about economic forecasting. Volumes 2A and 2B, which follows Nobel laureate Clive Granger's Volume 1 (2006), concentrate on two major subjects. Volume 2A covers innovations in methodologies, specifically macroforecasting and forecasting financial variables. Volume 2B investigates commercial applications, with sections on forecasters' objectives and methodologies. Experts provide surveys of a large range of literature scattered across applied and theoretical statistics journals as well as econometrics and empirical economics journals. The Handbook of Economic Forecasting Volumes 2A and 2B provide a unique compilation of chapters giving a coherent overview of forecasting theory and applications in one place and with up-to-date accounts of all major conceptual issues.Focuses on innovation in economic forecasting via industry applicationsPresents coherent summaries of subjects in economic forecasting that stretch from methodologies to applicationsMakes details about economic forecasting accessible to scholars in fields outside economics},

  abstract = {It is intuitive and theoretically sound to combine experts’ forecasts based on their proven skills, while accounting for correlation among their forecast submissions. Simpler combination methods, however, which assume independence of forecasts or equal skill, have been found to be empirically robust, in particular, in settings in which there are few historical data available for assessing experts’ skill. One explanation for the robust performance by simple methods is that empirical estimation of skill and of correlations introduces error, leading to worse aggregated forecasts than simpler alternatives. We offer a heuristic that accounts for skill and reduces estimation error by utilizing a common correlation factor. Our theoretical results present an optimal form for this common correlation, and we offer Bayesian estimators that can be used in practice. The common correlation heuristic is shown to outperform alternative combination methods on macroeconomic and experimental forecasting where there are limited historical data.

The key ingredient in BPS is a ``synthesis'' function. This is typically specified parametrically as a dynamic linear regression. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric treatment of the synthesis function using regression trees. We show the advantages of our tree-based approach in two macroeconomic forecasting applications. The first uses density forecasts for GDP growth from the euro area's Survey of Professional Forecasters. The second combines density forecasts of US inflation produced by many regression models involving different predictors. Both applications demonstrate the benefits -- in terms of improved forecast accuracy and interpretability -- of modeling the synthesis function nonparametrically.},

Information about events, macro conditions, asset pricing theories, and security-driving forces can serve as useful priors in selecting optimal portfolios. Moreover, parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty are practical problems encountered by all investors. The Bayesian framework neatly accounts for these uncertainties, whereas standard statistical models often ignore them. We review Bayesian portfolio studies when asset returns are assumed both independently and identically distributed as well as predictable through time. We cover a range of applications, from investing in single assets and equity portfolios to mutual and hedge funds. We also outline challenges for future work.},

Using both the existing and the new method, we find empirically that real-time macro variables have significant forecasting power both in-sample and out-of-sample. Moreover, they generate sizable economic values, and their predictability is not spanned by the yield curve. We also observe that the forecasted bond returns are countercyclical, and the magnitude of predictability is stronger during economic recessions, which lends empirical support to well-known macro finance theories.},

  abstract = {We propose a Bayesian-averaging portfolio choice strategy with excellent out-of-sample performance. Every period a new model is born that assumes means and covariances are constant over time. Each period we estimate model parameters, update model probabilities, and compute robust portfolio choices by taking into account model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and non-stationarity. The portfolio choices achieve higher out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and certainty equivalents than rolling window schemes, the 1/N approach, and other leading strategies do on a majority of 24 datasets.Received September 8, 2012; accepted October 18, 2015 by Editor Pietro Veronesi.},

The strategy assumes that excess returns are approximately determined by a time-varying regression with a large number of explanatory variables that are the sample means of past returns. Investors consider the possibility that every period there is a regime change by keeping track of many models, but doubt that any specification is able to perfectly predict the distribution of future returns, and compute portfolio choices that are robust to model misspecification.

  abstract = {Mean-variance portfolios constructed using the sample mean and covariance matrix of asset returns perform poorly out of sample due to estimation error. Moreover, it is commonly accepted that estimation error in the sample mean is much larger than in the sample covariance matrix. For this reason, researchers have recently focused on the minimum-variance portfolio, which relies solely on estimates of the covariance matrix, and thus usually performs better out of sample. However, even the minimum-variance portfolios are quite sensitive to estimation error and have unstable weights that fluctuate substantially over time. In this paper, we propose a class of portfolios that have better stability properties than the traditional minimum-variance portfolios. The proposed portfolios are constructed using certain robust estimators and can be computed by solving a single nonlinear program, where robust estimation and portfolio optimization are performed in a single step. We show analytically that the resulting portfolio weights are less sensitive to changes in the asset-return distribution than those of the traditional portfolios. Moreover, our numerical results on simulated and empirical data confirm that the proposed portfolios are more stable than the traditional minimum-variance portfolios, while preserving (or slightly improving) their relatively good out-of-sample performance.},

  abstract = {Economic theory tells us that market and credit risks are intrinsically related to each other and not separable. We describe the two main approaches to pricing credit risky instruments: the structural approach and the reduced form approach. It is argued that the standard approaches to credit risk management – CreditMetrics, CreditRisk+ and KMV – are of limited value when applied to portfolios of interest rate sensitive instruments and in measuring market and credit risk. Empirically returns on high yield bonds have a higher correlation with equity index returns and a lower correlation with Treasury bond index returns than do low yield bonds. Also, macro economic variables appear to influence the aggregate rate of business failures. The CreditMetrics, CreditRisk+ and KMV methodologies cannot reproduce these empirical observations given their constant interest rate assumption. However, we can incorporate these empirical observations into the reduced form of Jarrow and Turnbull (1995b). Drawing the analogy. Risk 5, 63–70 model. Here default probabilities are correlated due to their dependence on common economic factors. Default risk and recovery rate uncertainty may not be the sole determinants of the credit spread. We show how to incorporate a convenience yield as one of the determinants of the credit spread. For credit risk management, the time horizon is typically one year or longer. This has two important implications, since the standard approximations do not apply over a one year horizon. First, we must use pricing models for risk management. Some practitioners have taken a different approach than academics in the pricing of credit risky bonds. In the event of default, a bond holder is legally entitled to accrued interest plus principal. We discuss the implications of this fact for pricing. Second, it is necessary to keep track of two probability measures: the martingale probability for pricing and the natural probability for value-at-risk. We discuss the benefits of keeping track of these two measures.},

  abstract = {Random label noises (or observational noises) widely exist in practical machine learning settings. While previous studies primarily focus on the affects of label noises to the performance of learning, our work intends to investigate the implicit regularization effects of the label noises, under mini-batch sampling settings of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with assumptions that label noises are unbiased. Specifically, we analyze the learning dynamics of SGD over the quadratic loss with unbiased label noises, where we model the dynamics of SGD as a stochastic differentiable equation (SDE) with two diffusion terms (namely a Doubly Stochastic Model). While the first diffusion term is caused by mini-batch sampling over the (label-noiseless) loss gradients as many other works on SGD, our model investigates the second noise term of SGD dynamics, which is caused by mini-batch sampling over the label noises, as an implicit regularizer. Our theoretical analysis finds such implicit regularizer would favor some convergence points that could stabilize model outputs against perturbation of parameters (namely inference stability). Though similar phenomenon have been investigated, our work doesn't assume SGD as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck like process and achieve a more generalizable result with convergence of approximation proved. To validate our analysis, we design two sets of empirical studies to analyze the implicit regularizer of SGD with unbiased random label noises for deep neural networks training and linear regression.},

However, the mechanisms behind this improvement remain elusive. In this work, we investigate embeddings and attention representations in Llama-2 70B and Vicuna 13B. Specifically, we study how embeddings and attention change after in-context-learning, and how these changes mediate improvement in behavior. We employ neuroscience-inspired techniques, such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), and propose novel methods for parameterized probing and attention ratio analysis (ARA, measuring the ratio of attention to relevant vs. irrelevant information). We designed three tasks with a priori relationships among their conditions: reading comprehension, linear regression, and adversarial prompt injection. We formed hypotheses about expected similarities in task representations to investigate latent changes in embeddings and attention. Our analyses revealed a meaningful correlation between changes in both embeddings and attention representations with improvements in behavioral performance after ICL. This empirical framework empowers a nuanced understanding of how latent representations affect LLM behavior with and without ICL, offering valuable tools and insights for future research and practical applications.},

The measure captures the aggregated spillover effect of the state-switches in the initial period on their neighbors’ outcomes in the second period. This paper introduces a causal network that captures the causal connections among the cross-sectional units over the two periods. It shows that when the researcher's observed network contains the causal network as a subgraph, the measure of diffusion is identified as a simple, spatio-temporal dependence measure of observed outcomes. When the observed network does not satisfy this condition, but the spillover effect is nonnegative, the spatio-temporal dependence measure serves as a lower bound for diffusion. Using this, a lower confidence bound for diffusion is proposed and its asymptotic validity is established. The Monte Carlo simulation studies demonstrate the finite sample stability of the inference across a range of network configurations. The paper applies the method to data on Indian villages to measure the diffusion of microfinancing decisions over households’ social networks.},

  abstract = {This article considers a stable vector autoregressive (VAR) model and investigates return predictability in a Bayesian context. The bivariate VAR system comprises asset returns and a further prediction variable, such as the dividend-price ratio, and allows pinning down the question of return predictability to the value of one particular model parameter. We develop a new shrinkage type prior for this parameter and compare our Bayesian approach to ordinary least squares estimation and to the reduced-bias estimator proposed in Amihud and Hurvich (2004. “Predictive Regressions: A Reduced-Bias Estimation Method.” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 39: 813–41). A simulation study shows that the Bayesian approach dominates the reduced-bias estimator in terms of observed size (false positive) and power (false negative). We apply our methodology to a system comprising annual CRSP value-weighted returns running, respectively, from 1926 to 2004 and from 1953 to 2021, and the logarithmic dividend-price ratio. For the first sample, the Bayesian approach supports the hypothesis of no return predictability, while for the second data set weak evidence for predictability is observed. Then, instead of the dividend-price ratio, some prediction variables proposed in Welch and Goyal (2008. “A Comprehensive Look at the Empirical Performance of Equity Premium Prediction.” Review of Financial Studies 21: 1455–508) are used. Also with these prediction variables, only weak evidence for return predictability is supported by Bayesian testing. These results are corroborated with an out-of-sample forecasting analysis.},

In this work, we develop a novel distributed estimation and statistical inference framework for the SAR model on a distributed system. We first propose a distributed network least squares approximation (DNLSA) method. This enables us to obtain a one-step estimator by taking a weighted average of local estimators on each worker. Afterwards, a refined two-step estimation is designed to further reduce the estimation bias. For statistical inference, we utilize a random projection method to reduce the expensive communication cost. Theoretically, we show the consistency and asymptotic normality of both the one-step and two-step estimators. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantee of the distributed statistical inference procedure. The theoretical findings and computational advantages are validated by several numerical simulations implemented on the Spark system. Lastly, an experiment on the Yelp dataset further illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {A purported `AI Singularity' has been in the public eye recently. Mass media and US national political attention focused on `AI Doom' narratives hawked by social media influencers. The European Commission is announcing initiatives to forestall `AI Extinction'. In my opinion, `AI Singularity' is the wrong narrative for what's happening now; recent happenings signal something else entirely. Something fundamental to computation-based research really changed in the last ten years. In certain fields, progress is dramatically more rapid than previously, as the fields undergo a transition to frictionless reproducibility (FR). This transition markedly changes the rate of spread of ideas and practices, affects mindsets, and erases memories of much that came before. The emergence of frictionless reproducibility follows from the maturation of 3 data science principles in the last decade. Those principles involve data sharing, code sharing, and competitive challenges, however implemented in the particularly strong form of frictionless open services. Empirical Machine Learning (EML) is todays leading adherent field, and its consequent rapid changes are responsible for the AI progress we see. Still, other fields can and do benefit when they adhere to the same principles. Many rapid changes from this maturation are misidentified. The advent of FR in EML generates a steady flow of innovations; this flow stimulates outsider intuitions that there's an emergent superpower somewhere in AI. This opens the way for PR to push worrying narratives: not only `AI Extinction', but also the supposed monopoly of big tech on AI research. The helpful narrative observes that the superpower of EML is adherence to frictionless reproducibility practices; these practices are responsible for the striking progress in AI that we see everywhere.},

Many studies have utilized machine learning or deep learning techniques to implement probabilistic forecasting reconciliation and have made notable progress. However, these methods treat the reconciliation step as a fixed and hard post-processing step, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and coherency. In this paper, we propose a new approach for probabilistic forecast reconciliation. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed approach fuses the prediction step and reconciliation step into a deep learning framework, making the reconciliation step more flexible and soft by introducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term into the loss function. The approach is evaluated using three hierarchical time series datasets, which shows the advantages of our approach over other probabilistic forecast reconciliation methods.},

  abstract = {Forecast combination integrates information from various sources by consolidating multiple forecast results from the target time series. Instead of the need to select a single optimal forecasting model, this paper introduces a deep learning ensemble forecasting model based on the Dirichlet process. Initially, the learning rate is sampled with three basis distributions as hyperparameters to convert the infinite mixture into a finite one. All checkpoints are collected to establish a deep learning sub-model pool, and weight adjustment and diversity strategies are developed during the combination process. The main advantage of this method is its ability to generate the required base learners through a single training process, utilizing the decaying strategy to tackle the challenge posed by the stochastic nature of gradient descent in determining the optimal learning rate. To ensure the method’s generalizability and competitiveness, this paper conducts an empirical analysis using the weekly dataset from the M4 competition and explores sensitivity to the number of models to be combined. The results demonstrate that the ensemble model proposed offers substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and stability compared to a single benchmark model.},

Bond return predictability is associated with periods of high (low) economic activity (uncertainty), which implies that violations of the expectations hypothesis are state dependent and linked to features of the business cycle. These state dependencies in predictability, established by introducing a new multivariate test for equal conditional predictive ability, can be used in real time to improve out-of-sample bond risk premia estimates and investors’ economic utility through a novel dynamic forecast combination scheme that uses predicted forecasting performance to identify the best set of methods to include in the combined forecast. Dynamically combined forecasts exhibit strong countercyclical behavior and peak during recessions. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

However, estimating global NH3 emissions from croplands is subject to uncertainties because of data limitations, thereby limiting the accurate identification of mitigation options and efficacy4,5. Here we develop a machine learning model for generating crop-specific and spatially explicit NH3 emission factors globally (5-arcmin resolution) based on a compiled dataset of field observations. We show that global NH3 emissions from rice, wheat and maize fields in 2018 were 4.3\,±\,1.0\,Tg\,N\,yr−1, lower than previous estimates that did not fully consider fertilizer management practices6–9. Furthermore, spatially optimizing fertilizer management, as guided by the machine learning model, has the potential to reduce the NH3 emissions by about 38\% (1.6\,±\,0.4\,Tg\,N\,yr−1) without altering total fertilizer nitrogen inputs. Specifically, we estimate potential NH3 emissions reductions of 47\% (44–56\%) for rice, 27\% (24–28\%) for maize and 26\% (20–28\%) for wheat cultivation, respectively. Under future climate change scenarios, we estimate that NH3 emissions could increase by 4.0\,±\,2.7\% under SSP1–2.6 and 5.5\,±\,5.7\% under SSP5–8.5 by 2030–2060. However, targeted fertilizer management has the potential to mitigate these increases.},

Note that under non-parametric point of view the regression curve is assumed to lie in a infinite dimension space. Regression splines use a finite approximation of this infinite space, representing the regression function by a linear combination of basis functions. The crucial point of the approach is determining the appropriate number of bases or equivalently number of knots, avoiding over-fitting/under-fitting. A decision-theoretic approach was devised for knot selection. Comprehensive simulation studies were conducted in challenging scenarios to compare alternative criteria for knot selection, thereby ensuring the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method was assessed using real-world datasets. The novel procedure demonstrated good performance in capturing the underlying data structure by selecting the appropriate number of knots/basis.},

  abstract = {Modeling the correlations among errors is closely associated with how accurately the model can quantify predictive uncertainty in probabilistic time series forecasting. Recent multivariate models have made significant progress in accounting for contemporaneous correlations among errors, while a common assumption on these errors is that they are temporally independent for the sake of statistical simplicity. However, real-world observations often deviate from this assumption, since errors usually exhibit substantial autocorrelation due to various factors such as the exclusion of temporally correlated covariates. In this work, we propose an efficient method, based on a low-rank-plus-diagonal parameterization of the covariance matrix, which can effectively characterize the autocorrelation of errors. The proposed method possesses several desirable properties: the complexity does not scale with the number of time series, the resulting covariance can be used for calibrating predictions, and it can seamlessly integrate with any model with Gaussian-distributed errors. We empirically demonstrate these properties using two distinct neural forecasting models-GPVar and Transformer. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in enhancing predictive accuracy and the quality of uncertainty quantification on multiple real-world datasets.},

In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides \$4\$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.},

In such a situation, a hierarchical forecasting strategy is more appropriate as well as a more accurate prediction methods to reach an efficient forecast. In this paper, we present a deep learning (DL) approach for hierarchical forecasting of traffic flow by exploring the hierarchical structure of the road network. The proposed approach is considered an improved variation on the top-down strategy for the reconciliation process. We propose a model based on two deep neural network components to generate a coherent forecast for the total number of road segments. We use N-BEATS, a pure deep learning forecasting method, at the highest levels for traffic time series, then disaggregate these downwards to get coherent forecasts for each series of the hierarchy using a combination of CNN and LSTM. Experiments were carried out using Beijing road traffic dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Particular attention is given to the issue of tuning the parameters of the algorithms and learning in unbounded domains, through adaptive and parameter-free online learning algorithms. Non-convex losses are dealt through convex surrogate losses and through randomization. The bandit setting is also briefly discussed, touching on the problem of adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits.

  abstract = {The ubiquitous missing values cause the multivariate time series data to be partially observed, destroying the integrity of time series and hindering the effective time series data analysis. Recently deep learning imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success in elevating the quality of corrupted time series data, subsequently enhancing performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recently proposed deep learning imputation methods. First, we propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review of these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also conduct empirical experiments to study different methods and compare their enhancement for downstream tasks. Finally, the open issues for future research on multivariate time series imputation are pointed out.

Although large language models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase. Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range of possibilities, including modality switching and time series question answering. We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research.},

In spite of this, the existing algorithms used to generate conditional forecasts tend to be very computationally intensive, especially when working with large Vector Autoregressions or when multiple soft and hard constraints are imposed at once. We introduce a novel precision-based sampler that is fast, scales well, and yields conditional forecasts from both hard and soft constraints. We show in a simulation study that the proposed method produces forecasts that are identical to those from the existing algorithms but in a fraction of the time. We then illustrate the performance of our method in a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression where we simultaneously impose a mix of soft and hard constraints on the future trajectories of key US macroeconomic indicators over the 2020–2022 period.},

This can be modeled as a time series forecasting problem, and Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to analyze historical patterns to produce forecasts. However, choosing a ML model that offers the best forecasting on the given data can sometimes be challenging. Furthermore, accurate predictions are usually unattainable using history alone, especially with the presence of foreign influences. This work investigates the effect of fire alarm device installations on the likely volume of fire alarms generated in a specific geography. The study involves data on the daily reported fire alarm numbers and daily new fire alarm device installation over a period of 15 months in five areas. Multiple ML models are trained and tested on the provided data, and the best-performing model is selected for each area. The results show that the best-performing model can be different for different areas and for different feature sets. Moreover, incorporating additional features related to the installed fire alarm devices boosts the accuracy of fire alarm prediction.},

Research in the last decade has established the importance of allowing time-varying volatility to capture both secular and cyclical variations in macroeconomic uncertainty. This recognition, together with the growing availability of large datasets, has propelled a surge in recent research in building stochastic volatility models suitable for large BVARs. Some of these new models are also equipped with additional features that are especially desirable for large systems, such as order invariance -- i.e., estimates are not dependent on how the variables are ordered in the BVAR -- and robustness against COVID-19 outliers. Estimation of these large, flexible models is made possible by the recently developed equation-by-equation approach that drastically reduces the computational cost of estimating large systems. Despite these recent advances, there remains much ongoing work, such as the development of parsimonious approaches for time-varying coefficients and other types of nonlinearities in large BVARs.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting problems arise when time series have a natural group structure, and predictions at multiple levels of aggregation and disaggregation across the groups are needed. In such problems, it is often desired to satisfy the aggregation constraints in a given hierarchy, referred to as hierarchical coherence in the literature. Maintaining coherence while producing accurate forecasts can be a challenging problem, especially in the case of probabilistic forecasting. We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for time series when reliable hierarchical information is present. We call it the deep Poisson mixture network (DPMN). It relies on the combination of neural networks and a statistical model for the joint distribution of the hierarchical multivariate time-series structure. By construction, the model guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the predictive distributions. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other state-of-the-art methods which produce hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasts on multiple public datasets. Compared to existing coherent probabilistic models, we obtain a relative improvement in the overall continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of 11.8\%~on Australian domestic tourism data, and of 8.1\%~on the Favorita grocery sales dataset, where time series are grouped with geographical hierarchies or travel-intent hierarchies. For San Francisco Bay Area highway traffic, where the series’ hierarchical structure is randomly assigned and their correlations are less informative, our method does not show significant performance differences over statistical baselines.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate how the use of computer vision is substantial in this scenario. Visuelle 2.0 contains data for 6 seasons / 5355 clothing products of Nuna Lie, a famous Italian company with hundreds of shops located in different areas within the country. In particular, we focus on a specific prediction problem, namely short-observation new product sale forecasting (SO-fore). SO-fore assumes that the season has started and a set of new products is on the shelves of the different stores. The goal is to forecast the sales for a particular horizon, given a short, available past (few weeks), since no earlier statistics are available. To be successful, SO-fore approaches should capture this short past and exploit other modalities or exogenous data. To these aims, Visuelle 2.0 is equipped with disaggregated data at the item-shop level and multi-modal information for each clothing item, allowing computer vision approaches to come into play. The main message that we deliver is that the use of image data with deep networks boosts performances obtained when using the time series in long-term forecasting scenarios, ameliorating the WAPE and MAE by up to 5.48\% and 7\% respectively compared to competitive baseline methods.

In the first part of our experiment, “workers” stated their willingness to continue working on a tedious task. We varied how many initial tasks workers completed before eliciting their willingness to work (WTW); some were relatively fresh when stating their WTW, whereas others were relatively tired. Later, a separate group of “predictors”—who also worked on the task—guessed the WTW of workers in each state. We find: (i) tired workers were less willing to work than fresh workers; (ii) predictors (in aggregate) accurately guessed the WTW of workers when they were in the same state as the workers about whom they were predicting; but (iii) when fresh predictors were guessing about tired workers, they substantially overestimated their WTW; and (iv) when tired predictors were guessing about fresh workers, they underestimated their WTW. Using an additional treatment, we find that workers also mispredicted their own future WTW, and we compare the magnitudes of intrapersonal and interpersonal projection bias.

In this paper, we attempt to answer this question using data from an experiment with two novel features: (i) survey information on consumers’ prior brand ownership, familiarity with each brand, and prior experience using different product features and (ii) eye-tracking data capturing search behavior at a very granular level. We find that consumers are generally more likely to search and buy brands they own and with which they are familiar, highlighting the importance of accounting for prior information. For this reason, we develop a search model in which both the information obtained during the search process and the information possessed by consumers prior to search are allowed to influence search and purchase decisions. Our model contributes to prior work by modeling search at the brand and attribute levels within a Bayesian learning framework. Using this model, we then quantify the impact of prior information on consumer choices as well as document the estimation bias arising when prior information is absent from the model. Finally, through a series of counterfactuals, we explore the managerial value of prior information data. This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing. Funding: Q.

Our method is motivated by the consideration of optimal prediction and focuses on the reduction of the effective dimension in conditional mean of time series given the past information. In particular, we seek a contemporaneous linear transformation such that the transformed time series has two parts with one part being conditionally mean independent of the past. To achieve this goal, we first propose the so-called martingale difference divergence matrix (MDDM), which can quantify the conditional mean independence of V ∈ Rp given U ∈ Rq and also encodes the number and form of linear combinations of V that are conditional mean independent of U. Our dimension reduction procedure is based on eigen-decomposition of the cumulative martingale difference divergence matrix, which is an extension of MDDM to the time series context. Interestingly, there is a static factor model representation for our dimension reduction framework and it has subtle difference from the existing static factor model used in the time series literature. Some theory is also provided about the rate of convergence of eigenvalue and eigenvector of the sample cumulative MDDM in the fixed-dimensional setting. Favorable finite sample performance is demonstrated via simulations and real data illustrations in comparison with some existing methods.

High TRUST also enhances stock return sensitivity to forecast revisions, especially for stocks with high institutional ownership. In contrast, the impression of analysts’ attractiveness (ATTRACT) is only positively associated with accuracy for new analysts or when a firm has a new CEO or CFO. Furthermore, while high DOM helps male analysts’ chances of attaining All-Star status, it reduces female analysts’ accuracy and the likelihood of winning the All-Star award. In addition, the relation between TRUST and accuracy is modulated by the disclosure environment and is attenuated by Regulation Fair Disclosure.

Previous work has found that the distinctiveness of a face influences its memorability—the degree to which face images are remembered or forgotten. Here, we generalize the concept of face memorability in a large-scale memory study. First, we find that memorability is an intrinsic feature of a face photograph—across observers some faces are consistently more remembered or forgotten than others—indicating that memorability can be used for measuring, predicting, and manipulating subsequent memories. Second, we determine the role that 20 personality, social, and memory-related traits play in face memorability. Whereas we find that certain traits (such as kindness, atypicality, and trustworthiness) contribute to face memorability, they do not suffice to explain the variance in memorability scores, even when accounting for noise and differences in subjective experience. This suggests that memorability itself is a consistent, singular measure of a face that cannot be reduced to a simple combination of personality and social facial attributes. We outline modern neuroscience questions that can be explored through the lens of memorability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {First impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces, and despite their questionable validity they can have considerable real-world consequences. We sought to uncover the information driving such judgments, using an attribute-based approach. Attributes (physical facial features) were objectively measured from feature positions and colors in a database of highly variable “ambient” face photographs, and then used as input for a neural network to model factor dimensions (approachability, youthful-attractiveness, and dominance) thought to underlie social attributions. A linear model based on this approach was able to account for 58\% of the variance in raters’ impressions of previously unseen faces, and factor-attribute correlations could be used to rank attributes by their importance to each factor. Reversing this process, neural networks were then used to predict facial attributes and corresponding image properties from specific combinations of factor scores. In this way, the factors driving social trait impressions could be visualized as a series of computer-generated cartoon face-like images, depicting how attributes change along each dimension. This study shows that despite enormous variation in ambient images of faces, a substantial proportion of the variance in first impressions can be accounted for through linear changes in objectively defined features.},

  abstract = {For modeling multivariate financial time series a single factor copula model with stochastic volatility margins is proposed. It generalizes single factor models based on the multivariate normal distribution by allowing for symmetric and asymmetric tail dependence. A joint Bayesian approach using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) within Gibbs sampling is developed. Thus, the information loss caused by the two-step approach for margins and dependence is avoided. Further, the Bayesian approach is tractable in high dimensional parameter spaces in addition to uncertainty quantification through credible intervals. By introducing indicators for different copula families the copula families are selected automatically in the Bayesian framework. In a first simulation study the performance of HMC for the copula part is compared to a procedure based on adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling within Gibbs sampling. It is shown that HMC considerably outperforms this alternative approach in terms of effective sample size per minute. In a second simulation study satisfactory performance is seen for the full HMC within Gibbs procedure. The approach is illustrated for a portfolio of financial assets with respect to one-day ahead value at risk forecasts. Comparison to a two-step estimation procedure and to relevant benchmark models, such as a multivariate factor stochastic volatility model, shows superior performance of the proposed approach.},

However, the nonsmooth quantile loss poses new challenges to distributed estimation in both computation and theoretical development. To address this challenge, we use a convolution-type smoothing approach and its Taylor expression to transform the nondifferentiable quantile loss function into a convex quadratic loss function, which admits a fast and scalable algorithm to perform optimization under massive and high-dimensional data. The proposed distributed estimators are both computationally and communication efficient. Moreover, only the gradient information is communicated at each iteration. Theoretically, we show that, after a certain number of iterations, the resulting estimator is statistically as efficient as the global estimator without any restriction on the number of machines. Both simulations and data analysis are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) are mainly conducted via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods. However, RLHF encounters major challenges including training reward models, actor-critic engineering, and importantly, it requires access to LLM parameters. Here we introduce Aligner, a new efficient alignment paradigm that bypasses the whole RLHF process by learning the correctional residuals between the aligned and the unaligned answers. Our Aligner offers several key advantages. Firstly, it is an autoregressive seq2seq model that is trained on the query-answer-correction dataset via supervised learning; this offers a parameter-efficient alignment solution with minimal resources. Secondly, the Aligner facilitates weak-to-strong generalization; finetuning large pretrained models by Aligner's supervisory signals demonstrates strong performance boost. Thirdly, Aligner functions as a model-agnostic plug-and-play module, allowing for its direct application on different open-source and API-based models. Remarkably, Aligner-7B improves 11 different LLMs by 21.9\% in helpfulness and 23.8\% in harmlessness on average (GPT-4 by 17.5\% and 26.9\%). When finetuning (strong) Llama2-70B with (weak) Aligner-13B's supervision, we can improve Llama2 by 8.2\% in helpfulness and 61.6\% in harmlessness.

  abstract = {Vector autoregressions (VARs) are flexible time series models that can capture complex dynamic interrelationships among macroeconomic variables. However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model toward a parsimonious naıve benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach, theoretically grounded and easy to implement, greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well in terms of both out-of-sample forecasting—as well as factor models—and accuracy in the estimation of impulse response functions.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a single parametric model adaptable enough to capture several of these features simultaneously. To address this, we propose a mixture of 4-way rotations of a parametric copula that is able to capture all these features. We illustrate the construction using the Clayton family but the concept is general and can be applied to other families. In order to include dynamic dependence regimes, the approach is extended to a time-dependent sequence of mixture copulas in which the mixture probabilities are allowed to evolve in time via a moving average type of relationship. The properties of the proposed model and its performance are examined using simulated and real data sets.},

We extend existing work that uses time series clustering to construct hierarchies, with the goal of improving forecast accuracy, in three ways. First, we investigate multiple approaches to clustering, including not only different clustering algorithms, but also the way time series are represented and how distance between time series is defined. We find that cluster-based hierarchies lead to improvements in forecast accuracy relative to two-level hierarchies. Second, we devise an approach based on random permutation of hierarchies, keeping the structure of the hierarchy fixed, while time series are randomly allocated to clusters. In doing so, we find that improvements in forecast accuracy that accrue from using clustering do not arise from grouping together similar series but from the structure of the hierarchy. Third, we propose an approach based on averaging forecasts across hierarchies constructed using different clustering methods, that is shown to outperform any single clustering method. All analysis is carried out on two benchmark datasets and a simulated dataset. Our findings provide new insights into the role of hierarchy construction in forecast reconciliation and offer valuable guidance on forecasting practice.},

Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA)provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples.In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance.

It can be regarded as an direct application of Bayesian inference to the problem of model selection, combined estimation and prediction. BMA produces a straightforward model choice criterion and less risky predictions. However, the application of BMA is not always straightforward, leading to diverse assumptions and situational choices on its different aspects. Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not accounting for advancements made in the last decades. In this work, we present an account of these developments through a careful content analysis of 820 articles in BMA published between 1996 and 2016. We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology. The results of the classification scheme and content review are then used to discuss the present and future of the BMA literature.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting has wide-ranging applications in business intelligence, including predicting logistics demand and estimating power consumption in a smart grid, which subsequently facilitates decision-making processes. In many real-world scenarios, such as department sales of multiple Walmart stores across different locations, time series data possess hierarchical structures with non-linear and non-Gaussian properties. Thus, the task of leveraging structural information among hierarchical time series while learning from non-linear correlations and non-Gaussian data distributions becomes crucial to enhance prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach named NeuralReconciler for Hierarchical Time Series (HTS) prediction through trainable attention-based reconciliation and Normalizing Flow (NF). The latter is used to approximate the complex (usually non-Gaussian) data distribution for multivariate time series forecasting. To reconcile the HTS data, a new flexible reconciliation strategy via the attention-based encoder-decoder neural network is proposed, which is distinct from current methods that rely on strong assumptions (e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates and the noise distribution being Gaussian). Furthermore, using the reparameterization trick, each independent component (i.e., forecasts via NF and attention-based reconciliation) is integrated into a trainable end-to-end model. Our proposed NeuralReconciler has been extensively experimented on real-world datasets and achieved consistent state-of-the-art performance compared to well-acknowledged and advanced baselines, with a 20\% relative improvement on five benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Long boarding times have long been recognized as one of the main reasons behind emergency department (ED) crowding. One of the suggestions made in the literature to reduce boarding times was to predict, at the time of triage, whether a patient will eventually be admitted to the hospital and if the prediction turns out to be “admit,” start preparations for the patient’s transfer to the main hospital early in the ED visit. However, there has been no systematic effort in developing a method to help determine whether an estimate for the probability of admit would be considered high enough to request a bed early, whether this determination should depend on ED census, and what the potential benefits of adopting such a policy would be. This paper aims to help fill this gap. The methodology we propose estimates hospital admission probabilities using standard logistic regression techniques. To determine whether a given probability of admission is high enough to qualify a bed request early, we develop and analyze two mathematical decision models. Both models are simplified representations and thus, do not lead to directly implementable policies. However, building on the solutions to these simple models, we propose two policies that can be used in practice. Then, using data from an academic hospital ED in the southeastern United States, we develop a simulation model, investigate the potential benefits of adopting the two policies, and compare their performances with that under a simple benchmark policy. We find that both policies can bring modest to substantial benefits, with the state-dependent policy outperforming the state-independent one particularly under conditions when the ED experiences more than usual levels of patient demand.

These forecasting problems are usually treated independently by learning different ML models which results in forecasts that are not consistent with the temporal aggregation structure, leading to inefficient decision making. Some of the recent work addressed this problem, however, it uses a post-hoc reconciliation strategy, which results in sub-optimal results and cannot produce probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we present a global model that produces coherent, probabilistic forecasts for different time granularities by learning joint embeddings for the different aggregation levels with graph neural networks and temporal reconciliation. Temporal reconciliation not only enables consistent decisions for business problems across different planning horizons but also improves the quality of forecasts at finer time granularities. A thorough empirical evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {It has become increasingly common to collect high-dimensional binary response data; for example, with the emergence of new sampling techniques in ecology. In smaller dimensions, multivariate probit (MVP) models are routinely used for inferences. However, algorithms for fitting such models face issues in scaling up to high dimensions due to the intractability of the likelihood, involving an integral over a multivariate normal distribution having no analytic form. Although a variety of algorithms have been proposed to approximate this intractable integral, these approaches are difficult to implement and/or inaccurate in high dimensions. Our main focus is in accommodating high-dimensional binary response data with a small-to-moderate number of covariates. We propose a two-stage approach for inference on model parameters while taking care of uncertainty propagation between the stages. We use the special structure of latent Gaussian models to reduce the highly expensive computation involved in joint parameter estimation to focus inference on marginal distributions of model parameters. This essentially makes the method embarrassingly parallel for both stages. We illustrate performance in simulations and applications to joint species distribution modeling in ecology.

  abstract = {With the widespread application of online advertising systems, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume (e.g., billions of user click logs). The large capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to its full potential, since click signals are not sufficient enough for the model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs and learn more robust and effective representations. However, current works on this line are still preliminary and rudimentary, leaving self-supervised learning for CTR prediction still an open question. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic Pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection (RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking and predicting a small portion of input features, and we also introduce Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world million-level datasets (i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods over several strong baselines, and achieve new state-of-the-art in terms of both performance and efficiency for CTR prediction.},

With the rapid advance of social network sites, network data are becoming increasingly available. The network vector autoregression (NAR) model incorporates the network information among individuals. The response of each individual can be explained by its lagged value, the average of its neighbors, and a set of node-specific covariates. However, all individuals are assumed to be homogeneous because they share the same autoregression coefficients. To express individual heterogeneity, we develop a grouped NAR (GNAR) model. Individuals in a network can be classified into different groups characterized by sets of parameters. The strict stationarity of the GNAR model is established. Two estimation procedures are developed, as well as the asymptotic properties of the proposed model. Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of our proposed methodology. Lastly, two real-data examples are presented, based on studies on user posting behavior on the Sina Weibo platform and on air pollution patterns (especially PM2.5) in mainland China, respectively.},

  abstract = {Click-through rate prediction is an essential task in industrial applications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\&MLP paradigm. In these methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way, user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\&MLP methods to capture user's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques: mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display advertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.},

In addition, when the components are known but the weights are not, we provide an application of the classic Glivenko-Cantelli's theorem that allows us to retrieve the Choquet measure supported on the identifiable admixture components.

Long-short strategies based on ChatGPT-4 deliver the highest Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, we find predictability in both small and large stocks, suggesting market underreaction to company news. Predictability is stronger among smaller stocks and stocks with bad news, consistent with limits-to-arbitrage also playing an important role.

It encompasses the models which accommodate, for example, transitivity, density-dependent and other stylized features often observed in real network data. By assuming the edges of network at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in the straightforward manner. Due to the possible large number of parameters in the models, the initial MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration based on the projection which mitigates the impact of the other parameters (Chang et al., 2021, 2023). Based on a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the stationarity assumption. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, and it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions.

  abstract = {Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical models given some observed data. A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.}

  abstract = {Among the many ways of quantifying uncertainty in a regression setting, specifying the full quantile function is attractive, as quantiles are amenable to interpretation and evaluation. A model that predicts the true conditional quantiles for each input, at all quantile levels, presents a correct and efficient representation of the underlying uncertainty. To achieve this, many current quantile-based methods focus on optimizing the pinball loss. However, this loss restricts the scope of applicable regression models, limits the ability to target many desirable properties (e.g. calibration, sharpness, centered intervals), and may produce poor conditional quantiles. In this work, we develop new quantile methods that address these shortcomings. In particular, we propose methods that can apply to any class of regression model, select an explicit balance between calibration and sharpness, optimize for calibration of centered intervals, and produce more accurate conditional quantiles. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation of our methods, which includes a high dimensional uncertainty quantification task in nuclear fusion.},

There are several time-varying and adaptive weighting schemes such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). However, the quality of different forecasts may vary not only over time but also within the distribution. For example, some distribution forecasts may be more accurate in the center of the distributions, while others are better at predicting the tails. Therefore, we introduce a new weighting method that considers the differences in performance over time and within the distribution. We discuss pointwise combination algorithms based on aggregation across quantiles that optimize with respect to the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). After analyzing the theoretical properties of pointwise CRPS learning, we discuss B- and P-Spline-based estimation techniques for batch and online learning, based on quantile regression and prediction with expert advice. We prove that the proposed fully adaptive Bernstein online aggregation (BOA) method for pointwise CRPS online learning has optimal convergence properties.

A well-known class of MC methods are Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In order to foster better exploration of the state space, specially in high-dimensional applications, several schemes employing multiple parallel MCMC chains have been recently introduced. In this work, we describe a novel parallel interacting MCMC scheme, called orthogonal MCMC (O-MCMC), where a set of “vertical” parallel MCMC chains share information using some “horizontal” MCMC techniques working on the entire population of current states. More specifically, the vertical chains are led by random-walk proposals, whereas the horizontal MCMC techniques employ independent proposals, thus allowing an efficient combination of global exploration and local approximation. The interaction is contained in these horizontal iterations. Within the analysis of different implementations of O-MCMC, novel schemes in order to reduce the overall computational cost of parallel Multiple Try Metropolis (MTM) chains are also presented. Furthermore, a modified version of O-MCMC for optimization is provided by considering parallel Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms. Numerical results show the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme in terms of efficiency in the estimation, as well as robustness in terms of independence with respect to initial values and the choice of the parameters.},

  abstract = {In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a particularly remarkable characteristic of Large Language Models (LLM). Numerous works have postulated ICL as approximately Bayesian inference, rendering this a natural hypothesis. In this work, we analyse this hypothesis from a new angle through the *martingale property*, a fundamental requirement of a Bayesian learning system on exchangeable data. We show that the martingale property is a necessary condition for unambiguous predictions in such scenarios, and enables a principled, decomposed notion of uncertainty vital in trustworthy, safety-critical systems. We derive actionable checks with corresponding theory and test statistics which must hold if the martingale property is satisfied. We also examine if uncertainty in LLMs decreases as expected in Bayesian learning when more data is observed. In three experiments, we provide evidence for violations of the martingale property, and deviations from a Bayesian scaling behaviour of uncertainty, falsifying the hypothesis that ICL is Bayesian.},

The finite sample properties of the estimators are investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation in special cases. It turns out that these estimators are biased, where amount and sign of the bias depend on the underlying copula, on the sample size n, on k, and on the true value of λ L .},

However, the majority of research has focused on point forecasting, with little exploration into probabilistic intermittent demand forecasting. This is despite the fact that probabilistic forecasting is crucial for effective decision-making under uncertainty and inventory management. Additionally, most literature on this topic has focused solely on forecasting performance and has overlooked the inventory implications, which are directly relevant to intermittent demand. To address these gaps, this study aims to construct probabilistic forecasting combinations for intermittent demand while considering both forecasting accuracy and inventory control utility in obtaining combinations and evaluating forecasts. Our empirical findings demonstrate that combinations perform better than individual approaches for forecasting intermittent demand, but there is a trade-off between forecasting and inventory performance.},

Recent work on the zig-zag has indicated its connection to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of the Metropolis algorithm that exploits Hamiltonian dynamics. Here we establish that, in fact, the connection between the paradigms extends far beyond the specific instance. The key lies in (1) the fact that any time-reversible deterministic dynamics provides a valid Metropolis proposal and (2) how PDMPs' characteristic velocity changes constitute an alternative to the usual acceptance-rejection. We turn this observation into a rigorous framework for constructing rejection-free Metropolis proposals based on bouncy Hamiltonian dynamics which simultaneously possess Hamiltonian-like properties and generate discontinuous trajectories similar in appearance to PDMPs. When combined with periodic refreshment of the inertia, the dynamics converge strongly to PDMP equivalents in the limit of increasingly frequent refreshment. We demonstrate the practical implications of this new paradigm, with a sampler based on a bouncy Hamiltonian dynamics closely related to the BPS. The resulting sampler exhibits competitive performance on challenging real-data posteriors involving tens of thousands of parameters.},

Our article enables PMCMC to handle a larger number of observations and parameters compared to previous approaches by generating the parameters that are highly correlated with the states in a pseudo-marginal step(s) with the states ‘integrated out’; the rest of the parameters are generated conditional on the states. We make the pseudo-marginal step much more efficient than previous approaches by positively correlating the numerator and denominator in the Metropolis–Hastings acceptance probability in a novel way by expressing the target density of the PMCMC in terms of the basic uniform or normal random numbers used in the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, instead of the standard way which expresses the target density in terms of the state particles. We also show that the new sampler combines and generalizes two separate particle MCMC approaches: particle Gibbs and the correlated pseudo-marginal Metropolis–Hastings. We investigate the performance of this hybrid sampler empirically by applying it to univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models having both a large number of parameters and a large number of latent states and show that it is much more efficient than competing PMCMC methods. An online supplement to the article and computer code are available online.},

The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with the performance of a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models.

  abstract = {Time series methods are used to make long-run forecasts, with confidence intervals, of age-specific mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2065. First, the logs of the age-specific death rates are modeled as a linear function of an unobserved period-specific intensity index, with parameters depending on age. This model is fit to the matrix of U.S. death rates, 1933 to 1987, using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method; it accounts for almost all the variance over time in age-specific death rates as a group. Whereas e 0 has risen at a decreasing rate over the century and has decreasing variability, k(t) declines at a roughly constant rate and has roughly constant variability, facilitating forecasting. k(t), which indexes the intensity of mortality, is next modeled as a time series (specifically, a random walk with drift) and forecast. The method performs very well on within-sample forecasts, and the forecasts are insensitive to reductions in the length of the base period from 90 to 30 years; some instability appears for base periods of 10 or 20 years, however. Forecasts of age-specific rates are derived from the forecasts of k, and other life table variables are derived and presented. These imply an increase of 10.5 years in life expectancy to 86.05 in 2065 (sexes combined), with a confidence band of plus 3.9 or minus 5.6 years, including uncertainty concerning the estimated trend. Whereas 46\% now survive to age 80, by 2065 46\% will survive to age 90. Of the gains forecast for person-years lived over the life cycle from now until 2065, 74\% will occur at age 65 and over. These life expectancy forecasts are substantially lower than direct time series forecasts of e 0, and have far narrower confidence bands; however, they are substantially higher than the forecasts of the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary.},

The two novel contributions are to use well-known stochastic mortality models as weak learners in gradient boosting rather than trees, and to include a penalty that shrinks mortality forecasts in adjacent age groups and nearby geographical regions closer together. The proposed method demonstrates superior forecasting performance based on US male mortality data from 1969 to 2019. The proposed approach also enables us to interpret and visualize the results. The boosted model with age-based shrinkage yields the most accurate national-level mortality forecast. For state-level forecasts, spatial shrinkage provides further improvement in accuracy in addition to the benefits of age-based shrinkage. This improvement can be attributed to data sharing across states with large and small populations in adjacent regions and states with common risk factors.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the preference-based top-K rank aggregation problem. Suppose that a collection of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one wishes to recover a consistent ordering that emphasizes the top-K ranked items, based on partially revealed preferences. We focus on the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set of latent preference scores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only on the relative scores of the items involved. We characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-K ranked items, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results highlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores between the K-th and (K+1)-th ranked items. The minimum sample complexity required for reliable top-K ranking scales inversely with the separation measure irrespective of other preference distribution metrics. To approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme, called Spectral MLE, that returns the indices of the top-K items in accordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with an initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral method), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of coordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-K item identification under minimal sample complexity. The practical applicability of Spectral MLE is further corroborated by numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Rank aggregation based on pairwise comparisons over a set of items has a wide range of applications. Although considerable research has been devoted to the development of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to efficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the ranking accuracy under a budget constraint. We further develop a computationally efficient sampling policy based on knowledge gradient as well as a moment matching technique for posterior approximation. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed policy achieves high ranking accuracy with a lower labeling cost.},

However, the potential of this task has not been fully exploited since existing VSP methods only focus on modeling visual saliency of the input previous frames. In this paper, we present the first attempt to extend this task to video saliency forecasting (VSF) by forecasting attention regions of consecutive future frames. To tackle this problem, we propose a video saliency forecasting transformer (VSFT) network built on a new encoder-decoder architecture. Different from existing VSP methods, our VSFT is the first pure-transformer based architecture in the VSP field and is freed from the dependency of the pretrained S3D model. In VSFT, the attention mechanism is exploited to capture spatial-temporal dependencies between the input past frames and the target future frame. We propose cross-attention guidance blocks (CAGB) to aggregate multi-level representation features to provide sufficient guidance for forecasting. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, DHF1K and Hollywoods-2. We investigate the saliency forecasting and predicting abilities of existing VSP methods by modifying the supervision signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both VSF and VSP tasks.},

  abstract = {Long-term activity forecasting is an especially challenging research problem because it requires understanding the temporal relationships between observed actions, as well as the variability and complexity of human activities. Despite relying on strong supervision via expensive human annotations, state-of-the-art forecasting approaches often generalize poorly to unseen data. To alleviate this issue, we propose Multiscale Video Pretraining (MVP), a novel self-supervised pretraining approach that learns robust representations for forecasting by learning to predict contextualized representations of future video clips over multiple timescales. MVP is based on our observation that actions in videos have a multiscale nature, where atomic actions typically occur at a short timescale and more complex actions may span longer timescales. We compare MVP to state-of-the-art self-supervised video learning approaches on downstream long-term forecasting tasks including long-term action anticipation and video summary prediction. Our comprehensive experiments across the Ego4D and Epic-Kitchens-55/100 datasets demonstrate that MVP out-performs state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Notably, MVP obtains a relative performance gain of over 20\% accuracy in video summary forecasting over existing methods.},

Experiments suggest this model can generate tiny videos up to a second at full frame rate better than simple baselines, and we show its utility at predicting plausible futures of static images. Moreover, experiments and visualizations show the model internally learns useful features for recognizing actions with minimal supervision, suggesting scene dynamics are a promising signal for representation learning.

In this work, we address the challenge of predicting prices evolution among multiple potentially interacting financial assets. A solution to this problem has obvious importance for governments, banks, and investors. Statistical methods such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are widely applied to these problems. In this paper, we propose to approach economic time series forecasting of multiple financial assets in a novel way via video prediction. Given past prices of multiple potentially interacting financial assets, we aim to predict the prices evolution in the future. Instead of treating the snapshot of prices at each time point as a vector, we spatially layout these prices in 2D as an image similar to market change visualization, and we can harness the power of CNNs in learning a latent representation for these financial assets. Thus, the history of these prices becomes a sequence of images, and our goal becomes predicting future images. We build on advances from computer vision for video prediction. Our experiments involve the prediction task of the price evolution of nine financial assets traded in U.S. stock markets. The proposed method outperforms baselines including ARIMA, Prophet and variations of the proposed method, demonstrating the benefits of harnessing the power of CNNs in the problem of economic time series forecasting.},

  abstract = {Time series are critical for decision-making in fields like finance and healthcare. Their importance has driven a recent influx of works passing time series into language models, leading to non-trivial forecasting on some datasets. But it remains unknown whether non-trivial forecasting implies that language models can reason about time series. To address this gap, we generate a first-of-its-kind evaluation framework for time series reasoning, including formal tasks and a corresponding dataset of multi-scale time series paired with text captions across ten domains. Using these data, we probe whether language models achieve three forms of reasoning: (1) Etiological Reasoning - given an input time series, can the language model identify the scenario that most likely created it? (2) Question Answering - can a language model answer factual questions about time series? (3) Context-Aided Forecasting - does highly relevant textual context improve a language model's time series forecasts? We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting. These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research. We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage},

Specifically, our Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1\% on Kinetics-400, 83.6\% on Kinetics-600, 72.7\% on Kinetics-700, and 41.1\% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training. Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to 64.7\% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images. VATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event recognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4\% on AudioSet without any supervised pre-training.},

The unified VLP model is pre-trained on a large amount of image-text pairs using the unsupervised learning objectives of two tasks: bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) masked vision-language prediction. The two tasks differ solely in what context the prediction conditions on. This is controlled by utilizing specific self-attention masks for the shared transformer network.

Transformer is an effective model to deal with this problem, and surpasses RNN-based methods in several sequence modeling tasks, such as machine translation, video captioning, etc. Motivated by the great success of transformer and the natural structure of video (frame-shot-video), a hierarchical transformer is developed for video summarization, which can capture the dependencies among frame and shots, and summarize the video by exploiting the scene information formed by shots. Furthermore, we argue that both the audio and visual information are essential for the video summarization task. To integrate the two kinds of information, they are encoded in a two-stream scheme, and a multimodal fusion mechanism is developed based on the hierarchical transformer. In this paper, the proposed method is denoted as Hierarchical Multimodal Transformer (HMT). Practically, extensive experiments show that HMT achieves (F-measure: 0.441, Kendall’s τ: 0.079, Spearman’s ρ: 0.080) and (F-measure: 0.601, Kendall’s τ: 0.096, Spearman’s ρ: 0.107) on SumMe and TVsum, respectively. It surpasses most of the traditional, RNN-based and attention-based video summarization methods.},

  abstract = {在大数据时代，计算机技术的不断进步和时间序列数据的激增促进了时间序列预测研究的发展。有效的预测对于个人、企业乃至国家层面的决策都起着至关重要的作用。时间序列由于存在趋势性、季节性、周期性等特点，使得数据生成过程是有规律可循的，这为预测提供了可能性。但由于外部因素复杂多变，真实的时间序列数据不可避免的存在一定的随机性，这给预测任务带来了多源的复杂性。因此近几十年来，大量预测模型不断涌现。然而任何单一模型都有自身的缺 陷与不足，也都有各自不同的适用范围和条件，难以寻找到一种适用于所有数据 类型的预测方法。于是将单一模型进行组合的思想应运而生。预测组合在保证较 高预测精度的同时还能有效降低系统风险，因而该思想被广泛应用于时间序列预 测领域。 本文延续预测模型组合策略的思想，面向复杂时间序列，进一步研究模型组 合在解决不同预测难题中的贡献。时间序列的复杂性可以体现在以下几个方面： （1）时间序列模式随时间变化，即使是一条时间序列在不同的时间阶段也可能 存在截然不同的特征；（2）时间序列数据生成过程存在随机性和不确定性，特 别是在某些领域需求的产生是偶发的，存在大量零值且变化剧烈；（3）时间序 列数据通常根据其背景和特征进行分组，形成了横断面层次结构，预测结果应满 足分层结构的限制条件。本文面向上述时间序列预测中存在的挑战，建立预测组 合模型，以提升预测精度以及在决策管理中的应用价值。本文的主要研究内容及 结论如下： 1. 对于非平稳时间序列，统计特性随时间变化，因而可以基于时变特征构 造时变的预测组合权重，提出了时变特征驱动的密度预测模型组合框架。并通过 自动的贝叶斯变量选择方法衡量不同特征的重要性。与黑箱预测组合方案相比， 提出的方法具有更好的可解释性。最后应用于预测股票市场数据和 M3 竞赛数据， 验证了提出方法的有效性和优越性。 2. 面向间歇时间序列，对传统的预测组合方法进行了讨论和比较，并提出 了基于特征的间歇时间序列预测组合框架。考虑两类可以描述间歇时间序列的特 征，基于元学习模型，自动学习特征和组合权重的关系。提出的框架被应用于两 个真实数据集的预测，实验结果发现，提出的方法能提高点预测和分位数预测精 i度，为实际库存管理决策提供支持。 3. 在分层时间序列预测背景下，以死亡率预测为例进行研究，基于层次内 和层次间时间序列的相关关系，建立符合数据结构特点的预测模型。基于梯度提 升的思想，对死亡率预测进行建模，同时考虑年龄和空间层面的收缩。获得基础 预测后，利用调和预测组合方法进行调和，以满足死亡率分层结构的一致性。实 验结果发现，提出的方法实现了更高的整体预测准确性。},

  abstract = {We propose four different estimators that take into account the autocorrelation structure when reconciling forecasts in a temporal hierarchy. Combining forecasts from multiple temporal aggregation levels exploits information differences and mitigates model uncertainty, while reconciliation ensures a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different horizons. In previous studies, weights assigned to the forecasts were given by the structure of the hierarchy or the forecast error variances without considering potential autocorrelation in the forecast errors. Our first estimator considers the autocovariance matrix within each aggregation level. Since this can be difficult to estimate, we propose a second estimator that blends autocorrelation and variance information, but only requires estimation of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient at each aggregation level. Our third and fourth estimators facilitate information sharing between aggregation levels using robust estimates of the cross-correlation matrix and its inverse. We compare the proposed estimators in a simulation study and demonstrate their usefulness through an application to short-term electricity load forecasting in four price areas in Sweden. We find that by taking account of auto- and cross-covariances when reconciling forecasts, accuracy can be significantly improved uniformly across all frequencies and areas.},

  abstract = {Bayesian whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis with three-dimensional spatial smoothing priors has been shown to produce state-of-the-art activity maps without pre-smoothing the data. The proposed inference algorithms are computationally demanding however, and the spatial priors used have several less appealing properties, such as being improper and having infinite spatial range. We propose a statistical inference framework for whole-brain fMRI analysis based on the class of Matérn covariance functions. The framework uses the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) representation of possibly anisotropic spatial Matérn fields via the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach of Lindgren et al. (2011). This allows for more flexible and interpretable spatial priors, while maintaining the sparsity required for fast inference in the high-dimensional whole-brain setting. We develop an accelerated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm for empirical Bayes (EB) inference of the spatial hyperparameters. Conditionally on the inferred hyperparameters, we make a fully Bayesian treatment of the brain activity. The Matérn prior is applied to both simulated and experimental task-fMRI data and clearly demonstrates that it is a more reasonable choice than the previously used priors, using comparisons of activity maps, prior simulation and cross-validation.},

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

Although large language models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase. Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range of possibilities, including time series modality switching and question answering. We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research.},

We theoretically consider the forecast environments in which our approach is likely to offer improvements over standard methods, and we find significant forecast improvements from applying the proposed method across four distinct empirical analyses including volatility forecasting, risk management, and yield curve forecasting.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.},

It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-training performed on one dataset to other datasets also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

In practice, the challenge is to build a flexible but parsimonious model that can capture a wide range of temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose Pyraformer by exploring the multiresolution representation of the time series. Specifically, we introduce the pyramidal attention module (PAM) in which the inter-scale tree structure summarizes features at different resolutions and the intra-scale neighboring connections model the temporal dependencies of different ranges. Under mild conditions, the maximum length of the signal traversing path in Pyraformer is a constant (i.e., \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1)\$) with regard to the sequence length \$L\$, while its time and space complexity scale linearly with \$L\$. Extensive numerical results show that Pyraformer typically achieves the highest prediction accuracy in both single-step and long-range forecasting tasks with the least amount of time and memory consumption, especially when the sequence is long.},

  abstract = {Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.},

  abstract = {In many fields of science, we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR)—the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries—is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap—their construction does not require any new data—and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a framework for testing for associations in a possibly high-dimensional linear model where the number of features/variables may far exceed the number of observational units. In this framework, the observations are split into two groups, where the first group is used to screen for a set of potentially relevant variables, whereas the second is used for inference over this reduced set of variables; we also develop strategies for leveraging information from the first part of the data at the inference step for greater power. In our work, the inferential step is carried out by applying the recently introduced knockoff filter, which creates a knockoff copy—a fake variable serving as a control—for each screened variable. We prove that this procedure controls the directional false discovery rate (FDR) in the reduced model controlling for all screened variables; this says that our high-dimensional knockoff procedure “discovers” important variables as well as the directions (signs) of their effects, in such a way that the expected proportion of wrongly chosen signs is below the user-specified level (thereby controlling a notion of Type S error averaged over the selected set). This result is nonasymptotic, and holds for any distribution of the original features and any values of the unknown regression coefficients, so that inference is not calibrated under hypothesized values of the effect sizes. We demonstrate the performance of our general and flexible approach through numerical studies, showing more power than existing alternatives. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide association study to find locations on the genome that are possibly associated with a continuous phenotype.},

  abstract = {Replicability of results has been a gold standard in science and should remain so, but concerns about lack of it have increased in recent years. Transparency, good design, and reproducible computing and data analysis are prerequisites for replicability. Adopting appropriate statistical methodologies is another identified one, yet which methodologies can be used to enhance replicability of results from a single study remains controversial. Whereas the p-value and statistical significance are carrying most of the blame, this article argues that addressing selective inference is a missing statistical cornerstone of enhancing replicability. I review the manifestation of selective inference and the available ways to address it. I also discuss and demonstrate whether and how selective inference is addressed in many fields of science, including the attitude of leading scientific publications as expressed in their recent editorials. Most notably, selective inference is attended when the number of potential findings from which the selection takes place is in the thousands, but it is ignored when ‘only’ dozens and hundreds of potential discoveries are involved. As replicability, and its closely related concept of generalizability, can only be assessed by actual replication attempts, the question of how to make replication an integral part of the regular scientific work becomes crucial. I outline a way to ensure that some replication effort will be an inherent part of every study. This approach requires the efforts and cooperation of all parties involved: scientists, publishers, granting agencies, and academic leaders.},

It encompasses the models which accommodate, for example, transitivity, density-dependent and other stylized features often observed in real network data. By assuming the edges of network at each time are independent conditionally on their lagged values, the models, which exhibit a close connection with temporal ERGMs, facilitate both simulation and the maximum likelihood estimation in the straightforward manner. Due to the possible large number of parameters in the models, the initial MLEs may suffer from slow convergence rates. An improved estimator for each component parameter is proposed based on an iteration based on the projection which mitigates the impact of the other parameters (Chang et al., 2021, 2023). Based on a martingale difference structure, the asymptotic distribution of the improved estimator is derived without the stationarity assumption. The limiting distribution is not normal in general, and it reduces to normal when the underlying process satisfies some mixing conditions.

Popular methods include linear and tree-ensemble based quantile regression. We propose a neural network-based distributional regression methodology called `engression'. An engression model is generative in the sense that we can sample from the fitted conditional distribution and is also suitable for high-dimensional outcomes. Furthermore, we find that modelling the conditional distribution on training data can constrain the fitted function outside of the training support, which offers a new perspective to the challenging extrapolation problem in nonlinear regression. In particular, for `pre-additive noise' models, where noise is added to the covariates before applying a nonlinear transformation, we show that engression can successfully perform extrapolation under some assumptions such as monotonicity, whereas traditional regression approaches such as least-squares or quantile regression fall short under the same assumptions. Our empirical results, from both simulated and real data, validate the effectiveness of the engression method and indicate that the pre-additive noise model is typically suitable for many real-world scenarios. The software implementations of engression are available in both R and Python.},

However, traditional aggregated forecast strategies for panel data are mainly developed under the assumption that response variables are continuously distributed (or normally distributed). Replacing this assumption by a more general family of distributions, i.e., exponential family distributions, this paper proposes a computationally efficient way to construct the cumulative risk function and to explicitly accommodate the correlation structure of within-subject observations, develops two novel adaptively aggregated forecasting strategies via exponential reweighting and quadratic reweighting, and rigorously establishes the corresponding tight oracle inequalities. The proposed exponential reweighting-based strategy enjoys promising Kullback–Leibler risk-bound adaptation. Moreover, under the quadratic risk, a promising adaptation property can be achieved by the quadratic reweighting-based strategy. The risk-bound properties of the two proposed procedures in the presence of pre-screening are established under mild conditions. The calibration properties of the proposed methods are also analyzed. Simulation studies, together with an example in analyzing television viewers’ binary decision sequence of watching drama episodes, verify the superiority of our methods over existing model selection and aggregation methods.},

While most methods select the "best" model based on predictive quality, it's crucial to acknowledge other aspects, such as interpretability and resource consumption. This holds particular importance in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), as these models are often perceived as computationally intensive black boxes. In the challenging domain of time series forecasting, DNNs achieve stunning results, but specialized approaches for automatically selecting models are scarce. In this paper, we propose AutoXPCR - a novel method for automated and explainable multi-objective model selection. Our approach leverages meta-learning to estimate any model's performance along PCR criteria, which encompass (P)redictive error, (C)omplexity, and (R)esource demand. Explainability is addressed on multiple levels, as our interactive framework can prioritize less complex models and provide by-product explanations of recommendations. We demonstrate practical feasibility by deploying AutoXPCR on over 1000 configurations across 114 data sets from various domains. Our method clearly outperforms other model selection approaches - on average, it only requires 20\% of computation costs for recommending models with 90\% of the best-possible quality.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the success of introducing deep learning models to time series forecasting. From a data generation perspective, we illustrate that existing models are susceptible to distribution shifts driven by temporal contexts, whether observed or unobserved. Such context-driven distribution shift (CDS) introduces biases in predictions within specific contexts and poses challenges for conventional training paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a universal calibration methodology for the detection and adaptation of CDS with a trained model. To this end, we propose a novel CDS detector, termed the "residual-based CDS detector" or "Reconditionor", which quantifies the model's vulnerability to CDS by evaluating the mutual information between prediction residuals and their corresponding contexts. A high Reconditionor score indicates a severe susceptibility, thereby necessitating model adaptation. In this circumstance, we put forth a straightforward yet potent adapter framework for model calibration, termed the "sample-level contextualized adapter" or "SOLID". This framework involves the curation of a contextually similar dataset to the provided test sample and the subsequent fine-tuning of the model's prediction layer with a limited number of steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this adaptation strategy can achieve an optimal bias-variance trade-off. Notably, our proposed Reconditionor and SOLID are model-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of models. Extensive experiments show that SOLID consistently enhances the performance of current forecasting models on real-world datasets, especially on cases with substantial CDS detected by the proposed Reconditionor, thus validating the effectiveness of the calibration approach.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is crucial for decision-making to precisely forecast the future values/trends, based on the complex relationships identified from historical observations of multiple sequences. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90\% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.},

  abstract = {The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

  abstract = {Recent efforts have been dedicated to enhancing time series forecasting accuracy by introducing advanced network architectures and self-supervised pretraining strategies. Nevertheless, existing approaches still exhibit two critical drawbacks. Firstly, these methods often rely on a single dataset for training, limiting the model's generalizability due to the restricted scale of the training data. Secondly, the one-step generation schema is widely followed, which necessitates a customized forecasting head and overlooks the temporal dependencies in the output series, and also leads to increased training costs under different horizon length settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative pretrained hierarchical transformer architecture for forecasting, named \textbackslash textbf\{GPHT\}. There are two aspects of key designs in GPHT. On the one hand, we advocate for constructing a mixed dataset under the channel-independent assumption for pretraining our model, comprising various datasets from diverse data scenarios. This approach significantly expands the scale of training data, allowing our model to uncover commonalities in time series data and facilitating improved transfer to specific datasets. On the other hand, GPHT employs an auto-regressive forecasting approach, effectively modeling temporal dependencies in the output series. Importantly, no customized forecasting head is required, enabling \textbackslash textit\{a single model to forecast at arbitrary horizon settings.\} We conduct sufficient experiments on eight datasets with mainstream self-supervised pretraining models and supervised models. The results demonstrated that GPHT surpasses the baseline models across various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning settings in the traditional long-term forecasting task.

  abstract = {The ability to forecast far into the future is highly beneficial to many applications, including but not limited to climatology, energy consumption, and logistics. However, due to noise or measurement error, it is questionable how far into the future one can reasonably predict. In this paper, we first mathematically show that due to error accumulation, sophisticated models might not outperform baseline models for long-term forecasting. To demonstrate, we show that a non-parametric baseline model based on periodicity can actually achieve comparable performance to a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model on various datasets. We further propose FreDo, a frequency domain-based neural network model that is built on top of the baseline model to enhance its performance and which greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art model. Finally, we validate that the frequency domain is indeed better by comparing univariate models trained in the frequency v.s. time domain.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Robustness of Hierarchically Organized Time Series (RHiOTS) framework, designed to assess the robustness of hierarchical time series forecasting models and algorithms on real-world datasets. Hierarchical time series, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent in various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical evaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of benchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS addresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying the characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a set of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data distribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization component, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into intuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth analysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We illustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several algorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more robust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the transformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying specific reconciliation methods, such as MinT. RHiOTS provides researchers with a comprehensive tool for understanding the nuanced behavior of forecasting algorithms, offering a more reliable basis for selecting the most appropriate method for a given problem.},

  abstract = {To understand human behaviors, action recognition based on videos is a common approach. Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information, reducing the ambiguity of actions. In the last decade, many works focus on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring people with domain knowledge and even sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyze all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), accurate traffic forecasting has emerged as a critical challenge. The key bottleneck lies in capturing the intricate spatio-temporal traffic patterns. In recent years, numerous neural networks with complicated architectures have been proposed to address this issue. However, the advancements in network architectures have encountered diminishing performance gains. In this study, we present a novel component called spatio-temporal adaptive embedding that can yield outstanding results with vanilla transformers. Our proposed Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Embedding transformer (STAEformer) achieves state-of-the-art performance on five real-world traffic forecasting datasets. Further experiments demonstrate that spatio-temporal adaptive embedding plays a crucial role in traffic forecasting by effectively capturing intrinsic spatio-temporal relations and chronological information in traffic time series.},
